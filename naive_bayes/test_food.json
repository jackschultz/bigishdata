For those that believe in taking multi-vitamins, one serving a day is about the equivalent of one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins.  The serving size of  floor ounce per 8 ounces of water is about a teaspoon.  The taste was stronger than I was expecting, and the fruit punch flavor tasted more like a tart pink-lemonade to me.  This is similar to Crystal Light, but I found this product to have less of an artificial sweetener aftertaste.  Your mileage may vary as taste is entirely subjective.PROS++ Large bottle brings down the per serving cost of the product++ One serving equal to one tablet for the most common vitamins, such as vitamin C and the various B vitamins++ Less artificial sweetener aftertaste than Crystal Light or Mio, at least for me++ Added caffeine and Taurine may give some people an energy boost++ More economical than competing drinks like Mio and Vitamin WaterCONS-- Recommended shelf life is only 30 days-- No clear area to see how much is left in the bottle-- Bottle cap made of fragile cheap plastic and could be prone to leaking-- Bottle is too large and requires refrigeration, so it's not ideal for travel-- Still ridiculously expensive when compared to generic multi-vitamin tabletsWARNINGS++ Refrigeration recommended after opening++ Not for children!  It says so right on the bottle++ Some are more sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners than others, so try a sample first++ Multivitamins are not for everybody, so consult your physician if necessary++ Too much vitamin intake can be bad, so portion control is necessary++ Contains Taurine which is animal derivedThe product is not vegan friendly, because it contains Taurine which is animal derived.  Will the added caffeine and Taurine provide an energy boost beyond the product's nutritional content?  Your mileage may vary here as well.  I suspect this will not have a noticeable benefit to those who are used to consuming 40 ounces of coffee per day.  But it may replace the caffeine craving that many people satisfy with sugary sodas.The packaging is large, designed to make 24 portions.  It is re-sealable, and they recommend you refrigerate after opening.  But the cap seems like it is very breakable, particularly for a bottle designed to be stored cap-side down.  The signage is on a plastic label that surrounds the bottle, but there is no clear area to see how much product is left in the bottle.  Even with refrigeration, the recommended shelf life is only 30 days.  So this product will work best for those who have at least one serving daily.CONCLUSIONThis is a good product that provides another alternative for those looking for vitamins or a caffeine boost.  The shelf life is not very long.  And the packaging could use some improvement.  But the product itself is better tasting than I expected, and it will definitely appeal to some people.Enjoy.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2012", "summary": "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - Good Ingredients, Short Shelf Life, Poor Packaging"}

Very large (I have a photo at the top).  I usually get more manageable sizes to take with me when I walk/jog - a size that fits in the cup holder of my stroller.  Anyway I thought I'd give this a shot today since I was going for a longer jaunt, a 5 mile combined jog / walk with my stroller and perhaps I'd want more than just one small water bottle.The bottle size actually made it so I drank less because I had to store it in the bottom of the stroller and it wasn't readily available... so I only drank half of it and that was consumed at the end of my outing.  But I sort of felt more energized after drinking it - and I was quite pooped after 5 miles of pushing the stroller.  I don't know if that was psychological because I knew there were electrolytes in it or if there really was more of a boost.I can't comment too much on if the pH is of any benefit or not, I understand you have to drink this for awhile before any benefit kicks in... HOWEVER I did a quick search online to see if I could read anything from an independent source telling me why 9.5 pH or a higher pH in general is good for you and I couldn't find anything EXCEPT websites that were trying to sell me their products.  I couldn't find a website to tell me WHY this was good that WASN'T trying to sell me anything and that had some credibility.  So please keep that in mind.  One of the websites that was trying to sell me their pH stuff sited some \"Japanese study\" but gave no specifics... so I could not even look that study up to verify anything.  So it sort of leaves me to believe the pH thing may be a fad.  Probably a harmless one though.Bottom line... water tasted good.  I like the electrolyte thing.

If you or someone you know suffers from a gluten allergy (in the United States 1 in 133 people have gluten allergies), having snack food around the house can be a chore. This package is like a crash course of the types of foods you can purchase on regular basis.WHY It's GLUEN-FREE: All items are made from non-wheat flour. instead they are products from potatoes (PopChips Barbeque Potato Chips), seeds, rice flour, and grains (Crunchmaster Multi-Seed Crackers and Trail Mix), chick peas (hummus), and beef (Jack Link's beef nugget).TASTE: All food in this package is natural. Not all food is made in the United States; some of it is made in Israel. All foods very natural and gluten-free, but not all food were delicious.My least favorite items were the organic Sharkies chewables and the PopChips Barbeque Potato Chips. The Sharkies chewables tasted like a poor-man's version of licorice gummy bears, and although I'm generally a huge fan of the PopChips brand, I found the Barbeque style to be too spicy and lacking in true grit flavor. The chips, like all PopChips varieties, were not made by frying or baking.My favorite item was the Crunchmaster Multi-Seed Crackers. They were great with the Parmesan cheese spread (inside the smaller GoPicnic package), with the hummus (this package includes four little packets of Wild Garden Hummus Dip), as well as being crunchy on their own.In addition to the snacks, the package includes five \"single-use\" packackets of raspberry-flavored Vitamin C energy booster drink.Except for the parmesian spread cheese and the beef jerky (both inside the smaller GoPicnic package), all foods are also Vegan.PACKAGING: This is a 2-pound box of snacks that comes in Amazon's Certified Frustration-Free packaging. What this means is that all the items were in their own individual box and that box was inside a huge amazon box. This seems rather wasteful to me especially since all items are individually packaged.MARKETING: The Amazon product description says that no refrigeration or heating is required and while that's generally true, the four packets of hummus need to be refrigerated upon opening (assuming you don't eat them all first!). Sidenote: I'm a bit confused why this item is called GoPicnic Package and then contains items that are not GoPicnic items, and a box of GoPicnic items as well. Perhaps it's just the way Amazon packages things? To the consumer, this has no bearing on the flavor though.EXPIRATION DATE: Some of the other reviews mention that the expiration date was very close. I did not find that to be the case for the box I received. The frustration free box indicated the expiration date as June 9, 2011. This date was the least common denominator for all the products. Several of the items in the box, however, had an even further expiration date - the hummus was good till June 2012 and several items were good till August 2011.VALUE: The value of this package is questionable. It seems like a good box to send to someone as a present or maybe even to order once (for that gluten-free friend who is coming over to your party), and it might even be cheaper than buying individually. Still, this would not be an item that I would be buying every day. This is more a one-time purchase to taste all the foods and then to figure out which you like best and then buy those items instead.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2010", "summary": "gluten-free snack galore"}

Additionally, all of the items are gluten free.  The box contains the following items:1) Popchips BBQ Potato Chips: The Popchips are a great chip.  They are fluffy and light with a crisp crunch.  The BBQ flavor is sweet but tangy and the chips leave very little residue on your fingers.2) Crunchmaster Multi-Seed Crackers: These crackers are crunchy and wheaty tasting with a slight salty taste.  They are good alone or with cheese on top.3) Sheffa Zesty Snack Mix: This mix contains chickpea noodles, roasted corn, sunflower and pumpkin seeds.  It's supposed to be zesty, but it tasted bland overall, and had very little kick.  It was very fresh and crunchy though.  It did leave a bit of residue on my fingers however.4) Mareblu Naturals Blueberry Pomegranate Trail Mix: This had an obnoxiously sweet smell when I opened the bag, and I thought I wouldn't like it, but it was quite tasty.  The sweetness was slightly intense initially but quickly gave way to nuttier flavors.  It was very fresh and crunchy.  The mix is peanut free, and certified vegan.5) Wild Garden Traditional Hummus Dip: I've never had hummus before so I was a little leery, and I'm still not sure I like it.  This hummus was very smooth and had a spicy, bean like taste to it.  Not bad, but I'm not a hummus convert.6) Sharkies Watermelon Scream Chews:  These are like very healthy fruit snacks, and I like the idea of organic fruit snacks, but this flavor is way too sweet for me, and they were very gummy.7) Emergen-C Raspberry Fizzy Drink Mix: This is a powered drink mix that you add 4-6 oz of water to and are supposed to have 2-4 times a day.  Personally, I'd rather have it never.  It was way too sweet for me, almost like drinking fizzy pink sugar.8) Steak Nuggets & Cheese: The last item is actually a little box that has all the makings of a meal.  There are beefsteak nuggets (dry, dense, and tasteless), Crunchmaster crackers (see #2 above), Parmesan peppercorn cheese (tangy and tasty cheese spread), fruit and nut mix (very peanut tasting), almond roca (crunchy, sweet, and sticks to your teeth).All in all... with the exception of a few items, a tasty and healthy little box of treats.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2011", "summary": "Mostly good stuff in this box, a few undesirables leave a bad taste though."}

I've read through the reviews of this from the athletes, and if I were an athlete it would probably be a big deal in my mind.  On the other hand, I'm like everyone and get sick from time to time.  From being ill, I was dehydrated.  My doctor immediately told me to start drinking Gatorade or PediaSure.  I have never liked flavored sports drinks.  I hate the fact that when I am already not feeling well, I have to drink something I can't stand the flavor of.  I had previous tried SmartWater to solve this issue, but it doesn't seem to be infused with enough electrolytes to help.  So, this time I tried Essentia.  After about 2 liters, I did feel better.  You know that sorta dry, swollen tongue thing that happens when you are dehydrated?  That went away.  I felt a little stronger between drinking this and taking my medicine.  I asked the doctor if this was okay to drink instead of Gatorade and he gave me the go ahead.  So, here is what I liked:1.  It pretty much tastes like water.  There is a slight difference in taste from something like Brita water, or most bottled water, but overall it's not a taste that drives me away.2.  It is not sugary!  This is what drives me away from Gatorade.  I hate the sugary taste of every one of their flavors.  Since this basically tastes like water, it is not sugary!  This is the aspect that makes me dance for joy.3.  It made me feel hydrated after a bottle.  Honestly, it was probably less than a bottle.  If I wasn't already extremely dehydrated, it would have been even less than that.  I love it when something makes you just feel better.4.  It is a sporty water bottle that is made from environmentally safe products.  I'm not a total Go Green girl, but it is definitely a plus and something I am becoming more aware of.  I know that several of my high school athletes are very big in the Green shopping, so this is something I would recommend it.  It's also good plastic that is easily recycled again.The biggest con is the price.  It's not unheard of for a 12 pack of water to be expensive, but it is definitely not a drink the average family would be able to purchase several times a week.  A single bottle is just slightly more expensive than Gatorade, but a 12 pack for about $25 is much different than the supermarket brand of water that is a 24 pack for $4.00.

I guess sometimes just the chunkiness feels awkward on the tongue so it's more like a mind over matter thing and not that the taste is actually bad, but recently -after doing some serious thinking on the matter- I think I know why people prefer not to buy chunky peanut butter.  You actually unintentionally waste a LOT more than you would had it just been regular (smooth) peanut butter.What I mean is, if you stick your butter knife in a jar of chunky peanut butter, you'll end up using a lot more for one sandwich due to the nature of chunky peanut butter more likely to cling onto the knife compared to smooth peanut butter.  In other words, chunky peanut butter encourages a huge clump to come out at once which is probably not what you intended to do.  I guess if you really make an effort to take your time, you can assure your knife won't end up using too much chunky (if you have a ton of patience, that is).  For that reason alone, it's better to go with smooth since you won't end up wasting as much for one simple sandwich.

These rabbits can be spared. Early pioneers in pregnancy testing came up with the &#34;Friedman test.&#34;,  An improvement on the 1927 test developed by Bernhard Zondek and Selmar Aschheim that used mice (You can't sell dead mice on Amazon).  The rabbit test was an advance and consisted of injecting the tested woman's urine into a female rabbit. Examining the rabbit's ovaries a few days later you would find a change in response to a hormone only secreted by pregnant women. The hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), is produced during pregnancy and indicates the presence of a fertilized egg. The rabbit test became very popular and the supply of dead rabbits increased. The term &#34;rabbit test&#34; was first recorded in 1949 but became a common phrase in the English language. The people who didn't know any better thought the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant. The phrase &#34;the rabbit died&#34; became as euphemism for a positive pregnancy test. Actually all rabbits used for the test died, because they had to be surgically opened in order to examine the ovaries. While it was possible to do this without killing the rabbit, it was generally deemed not worth the trouble and expense, the cheapskates!  Due to medical advances, use of a live animal is no longer required. Folks the rabbits don't have to die. Don't promote their demise by purchasing this product.A replacement for the rabbit test uses frogs, specifically the African clawed frog, which like all frogs lays eggs instead of getting pregnant, and therefore can yield a positive result on the test without the need to be cut open in order to prove it. So do your pregnancy testing on frogs not rabbits.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2014", "summary": "The Rabbit Died is Not the Message You want to Hear"}

When you hit middle age all sorts of strange things start to happen...lol! But, the taste just isn't as strong / flavorful as the first batch I bought about 2 1/2 years ago. If they changed the type / amount of tea or spices used in the recipe, then it's not my imagination. If they did (and we will likely never know), then I'm not crazy. OK, I am, but the change in flavor is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.I used to love it; now I like it a real lot.This tea *is* yummy and usually works better for me than \"Smooth Move.\"The next part of the review may be TMI (Too Much Information) for some. You can stop reading now if you're uncomfortable talking about constipation. :-) I know many people (mostly woman) who have been dealing with this issue for years. Many things affect your digestion system: Diet, exercise, stress, medication, the amount of water you drink, etc.Here are my tips / advice. (I am not a medical doctor, nurse practitioner or even a Phd. If you are experiencing more than occasional constipation, you need to see a doctor.)Don't drink this tea all the time. It's like taking any laxative too often; it will stop being effective. Also, be sure to drink at least a glass of water after you finish the tea. More if you can.. I will sometimes drink half the tea and then let it sit overnight (covered) with the tea bag in it and finish the rest in the morning. If I'm especially \"stuffed up\" I'll use two tea bags.I use one Splenda packet to sweeten it. It's pretty sweet on its own; you may not need to add anything. Or a bit of honey is nice.The active ingredient is the herb \"senna.\" Just because it's not a prescription medication, doesn't mean it's not powerful. In fact, there are prescription laxative medications that are based on senna.The first time you use the tea, I highly recommend trying it in the morning when you can spend the day relaxing and near a bathroom. Nothing worse  than finding out in the middle of a date that this tea really works for you! (I'm lucky; my man of 16 years is so used to me and my \"issues\" I don't have to be embarrassed.)Eveyone's system is different. There are many factors that impact its effectiveness as a laxative. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work the first time or right away. It's a trial and error process. For me, drinking half of it before bed and the other half upon waking (with the tea bag(s) still in it) often works by mid-morning.I microwave a 16 or 20 ounce mug of water for 3 1/2 minutes. Then, dump the bag(s) and the sweetener, if using, in the boiled water. Cover it with a plate and let it sit until it's cool enough to drink (about 10 minutes).Even if it works, it's a good idea to clean yourself out completely every 1-3 months. Use \"Medline 1 EA/EA ENEMA BAG, W/SLIDE CLAMP, POLYBAG\"  (B0016LG9KMCheap and sanitary. I've stopped buying the red rubber kits. If you use them, fill with very hot water and a teaspoon of bleach. Slosh it around, let it sit until cool, then rinse with hot water, allowing it to run through the tubing.

But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about. Unless of course BPA free packaging is your primary purchase criterion. If so, buy em now and don't read any further.If not there are some issues to be aware of...I understand that Wild Planet is the brand. But what about the \"wild\" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that there's no other kind, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.Then there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're \"sustainably caught along the California coast\". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are \"processed in Viet Nam\". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, \"These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations\".There are other issues as well.The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, \"Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk...\". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.We also learn that these \"delicious meaty portions\" are \"cleaned and scaled\". Buyer beware: this is quite different from \"skinless and boneless\". \"Cleaned\" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.How do they taste?Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring.

My favorite granola is one from Trader Joe's that contains slivers of candied ginger. Ginger is just something that I miss when I go for too long without it.

I'm not really a big tea fan, but having tried a few Tazo teas with just a bit of honey or sugar added I was growing to somewhat like it. When I saw this Lipton tea had a coupon, I decided to go for it, since I like Green Tea anyways.Well, this is just disappointing. First, the packets contain a very very small amount of leaves, as in around 1/8 of the bag was filled with leaves. Second, they don't really have any smell, and even just making a small (around 7oz) cup with two bags still barely had any flavor. And worse, the flavor that was there was kinda disgusting. I tasted like a hint of minty-like flavor with some bitter...I don't know, trash-water flavor? I mean seriously, it was just gross. I've tried it on multiple occassions, and my wife who likes tea a lot more than me commented on how flavorless it was.Will not be buying Lipton again if this is what they've become; Tazo may be overpriced but I've never had an experience with them like I have with this tea.This is one of the very few one-stars I've ever given, but I really feel this deserves it. It's cheap, but even for cheap it's still not worth it.***Update 8/27/13***So we decided to tryYogi Green Tea Rejuvenation, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6), and while it is a little more expensive, each individual bag had more than double the filling of tea leaves, in fact closer to triple the amount, meaning only one bag is actually needed for a normal sized cup. Plus, it tastes much much better. We contacted Lipton about this flavor, and never received a response, I guess they're OK with trash-flavored tea with their name on it. We won't be trying Lipton products after this fiasco, this stuff just gives me nightmares thinking about, it really was that bad.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "08 22, 2013", "summary": "This is just bad..."}

The Kind comes out to about 50 cents an ounce and I can make a great deal more of a honey/almond/fruit clusters for that much.  Even if I added flax seed and quinoa.

I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.  If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips.  THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2011", "summary": "Not so great"}

I love that white cheddar stuff. I like to bring one of each. I can never eat too much popcorn and this way I can decide \"salty or sweet?\" Also yes the sugar is high, but caramel is sugar. That's basically what it is, melted slightly \"burned\" sugar. I found another good way to limit snacking is to bring regular popping pop corn.

The result is that this doesn't really taste like watermelon OR strawberry.  Instead, it fits some food scientist's \"flavor profile\" of those two tastes, kind of watermelon-ish, kind of strawberry-ish, but lacking in both. The flavor is just not anything to shout about, and no better than the other products on the market.I'm also not sure why it's called SWITCH.

When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.If being \"in love\" gives you a zest for life, then the \"I Love You\" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box):Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganacheLingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.Also Recommended:If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon.

It is a South American blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew, but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of Java.The coffee comes in an attractive,  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve.  The folks at Melitta know how to compact coffee for travel--all ambient air was sucked out of the bag, shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size, to a small, dense brick.  Cutting open the bag, there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size.  The aroma was intoxicating--think deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it.  The bag does not indicate the level of the roast, but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast (somewhere between a `full city' and European).  The bag states that this is an extra fine grind, but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than you'd want for fine espresso, and is more of a fine grind.  This, I imagine, is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine.For some reason, the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water.  I'm not sure how they drink coffee in Europe, but in the US coffee machines measure by the cup.  This leads to a bizarre ~2.7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and (to my taste) a slightly weak cup of coffee.  In spite of the grind, I'd stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there.  Your intuition should serve you well, and I'd stick with your usual measurements (I'm one of those `heaping' tablespoon per cup guys).The coffee definitely shows its South American origins.  In spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma, the coffee once  brewed is more light, breakfasty, and slightly more acidic than I imagined it would be. Given the type of coffee that it is, it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast. Still, it is a well balanced South American blend.  It lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded, less biting flavor.  Although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee, this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste.This is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark, earthy, and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own.  This coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffer--a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those Torani syrups (e.g.Torani Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)) for a little extra flavor, for those who like those kind of things.  It also makes a great iced coffee.  If cold brewed, the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet, but also loses a little personality in the process. (I did not try using this in an espresso machine as I do not have one, but I don't think that it would yield a great espresso.  Concentrated, I think the acidity might become overwhelming.)All in all, this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price.  With a little experimentation on the proportions, it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2010", "summary": "A fine breakfast coffee for your drip coffee maker"}

It smells like pink lemonade and tastes mostly like pink lemonade but with a strong vitamin undertone that's not entirely pleasant. I'd say Emergen-C doesn't necessarily taste better than EBOOST but it doesn't taste as strongly of vitamins.I decided to try EBOOST in the morning instead of coffee or tea to see what the effects would be and I did find myself feeling a bit more focused and \"energetic\" - I work at a desk so you can't really get that energetic, but I was feeling more intense and interested in my work as well as more awake. It doesn't have the same morning boost as coffee but you can't expect that from a powdered vitamin drink. (And coffee doesn't boost your immune system). I'd say it's a decent supplement for stronger caffeine-filled drinks.Overall I'd probably still choose Emergen-C over EBOOST on a normal basis based on the taste alone, but if I was looking for something to give me a morning jolt along with my immune system boost I'd go with EBOOST instead of Emergen-C, as I've never felt particularly energized by Emergen-C.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2010", "summary": "Seems to do everything it says it will - like Emergen-C plus caffeine"}

Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.

It had that rich, slightly bitter taste of an excellent grade of cacao. I stirred a little into a cup of coffee and it complemented it perfectly. I was impressed by how easily it dissolved into the brew as though it were sugar. But know that it's anything but sweet (no quality cacao is).I know that this is supposed to have health benefits, some of which I know first hand from using cacao for quite some time. I have not had this long enough to say one way or the other. What I can say, though, is I have tried a lot of cacao in my life and this one is everything the product description claims as far as quality goes. In fact, if you make mole poblano from scratch, you'll appreciate this because it has a richness that you will not find in grocery store cacao or cocoa.The reason why I awarded this five stars are it is genuine Criollo, it's non GMO (a big deal for me), and the intense flavor and characteristic bitter aftertaste. If you do a lot of gourmet cooking using cacao this is worth every penny. If you are looking for the health benefits, I am not going to make claims other than to say that this is an exceptionally high quality grade. For me it's going to be a cooking ingredient, something to enrich after dinner coffee for me and guests, and as a sprinkle over confections made with mascapone cheese.

And spit it out when I tasted it.  Forced myself to try another swallow.  And my thought process was, \"there is no way I can review this, it is awful.\"So I made real coffee, calmed myself down, and read the package.  100% chicory.  But everything on the package talks about coffee beans and such.  I came back to the page on Amazon and read more, particularly including the reviews.Once it truly hit me that this is ONLY chicory and is meant to be blended WITH coffee, I was willing to try it again.  I played around a bit, and ended up with a ratio of about 2/3 coffee to 1/3 Chicory.I like it.  I am using a bit less in total, and my resulting beverage is darker colored, which makes me feel like it is stronger.

The mostly non-English labeling and contents made me think it was probably wicked hot. As with so many things I was put off by, I'm kicking myself now that I've tried it, as Sriracha sauce isn't that hot and in fact has a nice touch of sweetness to it that makes it a great addition to Thai and Chinese dishes.  Truthfully it's nowhere near as hot as Tabasco sauce and on the Scoville Scale of hotness it ranks only at the 1,000-2,5000 range making it medium (Tabasco is the next level up).  As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Sriracha has a really unique consistency that is thicker than Tabasco, yet blends well in many Asian dishes.  I typically love northern Thai food and Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well.  Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale.  If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Sriracha gets my mouth watering. As I've learned, if you like to spice things up ask your server about the sauces and chilies and try a small little sample, but don't live in fear of hot sauces.  Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is it's a known quality and consistent, unlike the bowls of sauces and chilies in some Asian restaurants (believe me...I've had some that really took my breath away and I like it HOT).

While a tea purist may look down on a \"tea\" like this, its value for people switching away can be great (as it happened with me a few years ago)!Each box comes with 20 individually wrapped tea bags, each sealed in its little bag and glued in place. This can be useful if you are putting it in lunch boxes, picnics and the like.The recommended brewing time on the box is 1 to 1.5 minutes, so keep that in mind. If you are thrifty like me and want to squeeze two cups out of each tea bag, brew the first one under 90 seconds. Obviously the second will have weaker flavor, but it beats plain water.Reading the ingredients had a rather unpleasant surprise, modified corn starch. Leave it to the big corporate food companies to stick things like that in a frelling tea bag!The ingredients also include what seems to be a giant loophole for food companies, \"natural flavors\". It seems like they can sneak in a lot of things in under \"natural flavors\".The taste is definitely on the fruity side, I would call this a tea-inspired beverage, not proper tea.

I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this \"espresso\".The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009", "summary": "Not A Good Espresso Substitute but OK for Rooibos Chai"}

That will be great news to those with allergies to food colorants as well as to those who prefer to keep the amount of chemicals in their snacks to a minimum.  In addition to this \"taste of everything\" sampler, the beans are sold in several different mixes (like the 5-alarm spicy Man Mix or the fruity Soda Fountain Mix) as well as individually, so you can really create the bean collection that works for you!This sampler includes 16 flavors. Among people I know who have tasted these beans, there is a great divide in likes and dislikes--some that I hated, others loved and vice versa. Every person is different, so just because I hated something doesn't mean you will.  That said, following are my personal impressions on each flavor in the sampler:*****My Favorites--Could eat them again and again (and already have!).Grape: Tastes like Nehi grape soda from my childhood, sweet but delicious.Strawberry:  Bright, sweet flavor with a nice finish. Reminiscent of strawberry preserves.Root Beer:  Sweet and tangy, addictive and satisfying. Maybe my #1 fave.Pomegranate: Sweet and tangy, but in a totally different way than root beer. Yum!Cranberry:  Sweet and tart; like dried cranberries vs. fresh.Orange Punch: DELISH! Very sweet, bright flavor. Can almost taste the carbonation as if it was orange soda vs. orange punch.****My Liked-but-not-Loved List--Enjoyed, but don't crave them like the faves.Coconut: Very distinct, spot-on flavor, but pretty strong. Best in combination with other beans. Not something I could eat again and again by itself.Vanilla bean: Same reaction as coconut. Good in combo, not in volume alone.Green apple: Could have been more tart.  Tasty but a bit bland.Peach: Quite intense. More like peach nectar than a fresh peach. Didn't love the finish.Lemon: Expected it to be a fave, but it wasn't. It has the tartness of a fresh lemon, but would have preferred a sweeter taste, as was done with grape and orange (like lemonade).Black Cherry: Also expected to be a fave, but wasn't. I am liking it more and more as I try it, though. Better alone than combined with other flavors and better with 2 or more of the same flavor at once. Wish it had a deeper flavor.Blueberry:  I liked the inside but didn't care as much for the shell. Tastes more like a blueberry muffin than a fresh blueberry, but that is a good thing in my eyes. :)Ginger:  Powerful! Very spicy, like biting into fresh ginger. The flavor is beautifully reproduced, but was a bit overpowering for me to want to eat many.**Least Favorites--Flavors I have no desire to eat again.Bacon: Man, I WANTED to love this! I love bacon! But I didn't love this bean.  I didn't even like it.  It tastes more like Liquid Smoke than bacon. Yuck. Don't suggest you mix it with any of the sweeter beans.Himalayan sea salt:  Strange/alien on the tongue at first, but kind of interesting while chewing. This one was originally on my Liked-but-don't-Love List, but then I realized I had no desire to ever eat another one. Also tastes worse when eaten with other beans, esp. the sweeter ones.I wish there had been more mixable flavors in the sampler, like back in the days when Jelly Bellies were new and my colleagues and I were always thinking of new pairings to make delicious flavor combinations.  I did some combining in this sampler.  Can't say there was anything that really stood out as a great combo, though I would say if you don't like super sweet, you may want to eat the super sweet ones with something with a little tartness like the cranberry, pomegranate or lemon beans.Finally, the packaging was a little flimsy and my beans were intermingled when they arrived.  This was a bummer, since there are flavors that share a color and are hard to differentiate (like lemon and ginger, and the black cherry, cranberry and pomegranate) so if there was a flavor I disliked, it was hard to avoid it until I learned to distinguish the slight color or textural variations.  Some of the confusion could have been avoided by not putting like-colored beans in the \"cubby\" right next to one another, as lemon and ginger.All in all, a delectable bean with some very interesting flavors and natural coloring\\flavoring!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2012", "summary": "Delectable jelly beans with 100% natural flavors & colors."}

The size and rounded body are the perfect showcase for this unusual product. Besides, it is the perfect fit for my large glass latte cup. I've had no problem pouring the tea, and my lid fits perfectly. It is delicate, so I am extra careful.I've had no problem with the tea blooming using boiling water. I temper it with a metal spoon as a pour it into the pot. I don't want to chance cracking the tea pot. The tea tastes delicate and delicious. I get 3 pots from each bloom. I like my tea strong, so I brew it longer than recommended, but it never gets bitter. The second pot tastes best to me, but the 3rd pot is still excellent. And the colors of the brewed tea are beautiful also. They seems to glimmer with multiple hues. Don't ask me how or why.I will be reordering this tea! You can't put a price on the relaxation I get from this experience.

I want to keep it a secret!My husband and I decided that if we are going to be drinking something everything morning for the next 50 years of our life, we want it to be organic.  Fair trade just happens to be another bonus.  Both coffee and sugar are the highest sprayed crops in the world.  Coffee especially so we first made the switch over this brand and tried this flavor first.  We grind it at home and brew it with anAeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker with Bonus 350 Micro Filters.  The combination of grinding it fresh every morning and brewing it with the aeropress makes for the best cup of morning coffee EVER.  We use a simpleKrups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Blackand simply grind it for 15-18 seconds.  We also switched sugars and now use organic and fair trade sugar as well along with locally bought raw milk.  The best sugar for this isRapunzel Pure Organic Whole Cane Sugar, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6).YOU CANNOT GET THIS TREATMENT AT STARBUCK!It really does make for the best coffee in the world if you grind it right, brew it right and use wholesome ingredients.  My husband threw out his old coffee pot and went from being a die hard pot of Folgers a day to simply drinking four shots of this in the morning.  We both feel like we are drinking delicious coffee from Vienna every morning.  We tried this flavor first, but we are going to try theEqual Exchange Coffee, Organic Colombian, Whole Bean,12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)next by the same brand.  We prefer light roasts instead of darker roasts like French.  Incidently, most people don't know this, but the lighter the roast - the more caffeine in it and in our opinion, the better the flavor.  Darker roasts seem to really kill the flavor of coffee and you run the risk of more oils and higher acid and bitter flavor.  I don't really know why people like dark roasts and I think it is more the sound of it than the actual flavor that they fall for.  We both discovered at one point that lighter roasts such as breakfast blends and Columbian has better flavor, more caffeine, less acid, etc and ever since stay away from darker roasts.  We might also try theEqual Exchange Organic Coffee, Breakfast Blend, Ground, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 3)at some point as well along with the decaf so we can enjoy an afternoon drink.  I notice this particular blend seems to have two colors of coffee beans in it, one is light and one is medium.  No darks which we love!This might seem like an elaborate set-up, but we actually came about all this after struggling for a couple of years drinking coffee and getting sick from it.  I finally discovered that I am sensitive to the acids in coffee.  This put me on a lot of research on coffee, the acids in it, how it is made and the best ways to grind and brew it.  Both my husband and I are fairly frugal but after reading that coffee is the worst sprayed crop in the world except for Christmas trees (ever notice how Christmas tree farms have nothing but dead ground around the trees.... yeah, exactly like that!), we made the decision to do this.  Also, I now can enjoy and drink coffee every morning without any abdominal pain.So remember, this coffee + good filtered water + fresh grind + aeropress + rapunzel sugar + raw milk = best coffee in world!Enjoy!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2012", "summary": "Best coffee I have ever tasted"}

Love this whole grain black rice, also known as \"forbidden rice\". It tastes nothing like brown or white rice. It has an intense nutty almost chocolatey flavor. I can eat this plain as a meal, it is that good! Popular in Chinese, Thai and Japanese cooking. The grains are long and slender when dry but the rice plumps up sweet and sticky. Use in savory dishes as you would short grain brown rice or in desserts like rice puddings. I find it needs more water than the 1:2 ratio. It also helps to soak the rice overnight or at least 8 hours. Be sure to tend to it while it cooks as I often find myself having to add more liquid, unless you're using a pressure cooker.There are two different types of black rice. The more common variety is white on the inside and only the outer hull is black. I felt like I hit the jackpot when I ordered this and realized this is the far more rare variety of Chinese black rice with both outer hull and inside grain being black. Black rice contains the same antioxidants as blueberries, which gives it its color and is therefore more nutritious than brown rice.The bag contains the recipe for a traditional Japanese dish, black rice with sweet potatoes and scallions, one of my favorite recipes. I boil the rice in Japanese dashi, stock made with bonito flakes, kombu seaweed and dried shiitakes.I also like preparing slow cooker rice pudding with coconut milk and a hint of almond extract. Delicious both warm and cold, with a sprinkle of Chinese 5 spice.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 19, 2013", "summary": "Once you go black..."}

After having been to too many movies and had popcorn with that weird syrupy 'butter', I thought enough is enough!  Henceforth, I would only consume popcorn with a little salt and perhaps a little real butter as well.Until, before too long, I was coerced into eating kettle corn at a carnival, and of course I loved it.And now I'm trying the Kernel Season's Cheesy Seasoning Variety Pack.  While I was worried that my popcorn would be overwhelmed by artificial cheesy weirdness, all three of these flavors are actually very tasty when applied in the appropriate ratio.  The White Cheddar is my favorite, but when my wife walked in on an unlabeled bowl I had seasoned with the Garlic Parmesan, she just kept taking more and more and finally said... &#34;why is this so delicious?!&#34;Popcorn is a healthy snack which has been rendered unhealthy in a zillion different permutations (the horrors of 'movie theater microwave popcorn', for instance), and seasoning your own popcorn is a good way to see how addicted you might be to salt...  These seasonings have around 75mg sodium, or a modest 3% of DV in a serving; HOWEVER, HOWEVER, HOWEVER. this is in &#34;1/4 teaspoon&#34;.  The directions say &#34;sprinkle 1 capful onto freshly popped popcorn and shake well&#34;.  ONE CAPFUL IS AT LEAST 10 &#34;SERVINGS&#34;.  At least!  So, sure, you'll be sharing that bowl with 9 other people, so no biggie.  But you can see how easy it is to max out on sodium.  The great thing about this type of additive is, of course, that you can control how much you add!  So far our gang is getting by with much less than the recommended amount.I look forward to trying these mellow, cheesy flavors out on different foods (&#34;potatoes, fries, pasta, eggs, vegetables and more&#34; are recommended), and pretty much livin' life on easy street from here on out.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2014", "summary": "Hinting at cheesy goodness is easy!"}

Instead of picking up fast food, I prepare frozen burger patties and fries in the oven. I tried some of this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce tonight on the burgers and as a dip for the fries instead of the usual ketchup and mustard. It really woke up the taste and made a normally boring meal a little bit special.I don't know which particular thickening agents are responsible for mouth-feel in a dressing, but I tend to dislike whatever Kraft uses in their salad dressings and sauces; they tend to feel almost slimey or gummy (for lack of a better word) on my tongue with a decidedly \"plastic\" (i.e., overly processed/fake-food) taste. (And forget the low-fat versions of anything; I'd rather do without than have to taste those!) I prefer the taste and mouth-feel of Ken's salad dressings (especially the 0-carb Creamy Caesar), so if you are familiar with both of these products, maybe the following will make sense to you:The Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a lot closer to the mouth-feel of Ken's than to Kraft, but it still has something in it with a bit of that gummy feel to it. It's not nearly as \"plastic\"-tasting, though, and it's quite tasty on hamburgers I think. It's not scorching hot, but it's got a bit of a kick to it. It pairs well with a slice of raw onion.

It's not a bad device, but I definitely wish it had met my expectations. I love the idea and certainly hope more people will look at alternatives to the expensive, non-recyclable K-cups. Melitta is almost there.I got the Melitta to compare it to my Ekobrew since I've been unable to find them locally and the price through Amazon is double what I paid locally for the one I do have. Melitta seems too flimsy though. You have three main parts. There's a plastic frame for the paper filter, the plastic cup that fits around the frame, and then a snap-on lid. To use it, you place the frame upside down on the counter, place the paper filter over it, make sure it's even or you get gaps that the coffee will leak out of, and then push the plastic up over it. Fill it with coffee, snap the lid on, and you're ready to brew. The outer cup seems sturdy, but that plastic frame bends easily, so I'm afraid it's going to break after repeated use.My first attempt led to leaking grounds, so I had to try again. This time it was better, but it seemed like such a fuss to get the filter positioned correct, that I felt like I'd wasted time. Subsequent uses made it easier to know exactly how to line up the paper filter correctly, so I think it's a learning process.Now that I've used it consistently for a few days, I am pleased with what it does, but hands down, the Ekobrew is so much easier to use, and I'm not throwing away a little paper filter in the end. The paper filters are the other issue I have.I called around to local stores where I usually buy coffee filters and none of them have the Javajig filters. Most of them had never even heard of them. That means when I need more, I'm going to have to order them online or make my own from normal coffee filters. Amazon is currently sold out, so I can't see what their shipping would be. You can order the filters directly through Melitta for $3.99 a box and then $6.99 for shipping and handling. The shipping being more than the filters makes me think it's best avoiding the Javajig unless you want to make your own filters.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2012", "summary": "Feels Flimsy to Me & Filters are Hard to Find"}

The killer for me is that the broth is fairly well pervaded with mushroom taste, which is a real turn-off, and IMHO anomalous for a product describe as miso-flavored.  I'm fortunate that a certain local Japanese place offers fish-free miso soup, but we also make it at home (or use the Miso-cup instant).  For noodle cups, I'll stick with the chicken-flavor variety.Others have written complaining of salt and that the flavor doesn't knock their socks off.  I submit that this is the what you get in the dehydrated instant soup cup arena.  Tasty volatiles by nature aren't going to be captured in a dry broth powder, so there's only so good any product like this is going to be. If there wasn't a fair amount of salt added, it wouldn't taste like much at all -- this is true of anyone's soup cups.The tradeoff is that these are inexpensive, extremely lightweight, and last indefinitely on the shelf.  I use them for late night snacks, and especially when I crew sail races -- the boat owner generally has various processed food items to offer, but they're nearly always laden with animal products.  I can throw a couple of these in my bag and when hot water is available, have something warm to put in my stomach when I'd be otherwise limited to chips or such.

But white rice also gives me tummy trouble and this is made mostly of white rice. But that's not the only reason I gave it just 2 stars. As I've said in my other bionaturae pasta reviews, if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. All of their pastas are made from the same \"formula\" (that's what they call it).

I don't think I have been taking it long enough or consistently enough to notice a difference myself.  I've read it helps to prevent cancer so have been giving it to my dogs.  I've also heard that taking it with boswellia can help relieve chronic pain, another reason I give it to my dogs.  I did notice that it can cause upset stomach so it's best to build up gradually and maybe take it with a meal.  Another weird thing was that it made one of my dog's poop smell sort of flowery and pleasant.  Swear to god.I've tried a few other brands and have no complaints about any of them, other than I'm just not sure if they did anything and any improvement was just a coincidence.  But I still believe.  I was intrigued by this particular brand because it is the only one that says \"certified organic.\"  Also, it doesn't have all those little extra ingredients added by most other brands like magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide. I actually honestly don't know what those things are but figure I'd rather not be ingesting them if given a choice.For the reasons above, I like this brand.  Time will tell how well it works.  I do notice the powder is a much darker brown than the bright orange gold of other brands, but I suspect it has to do with the bioperine (fancy name for black pepper).  This is the first curcumin supplement I've used with this ingredient so I'm interested to see if I notice a difference in results.UPDATE 3 DAYS LATER:I have a 9-year old 55-lb dog with an arthritic leg. She is very active and still thinks she's a puppy so very little slows her down as of yet, including a limpy leg.  Over the past couple of years, her limp has come and gone away on its own, usually within a week or so.  However, late last year, it came back and has stayed for several months now, despite our attempts to control her activity level a little.I'm not keen on rimadyl without at least trying more natural remedies.  I have been giving her some herbal concoction for pets marketed for arthritis for the past month and it hasn't helped at all.Enter boswellia + turmeric.  I started her onSource Naturals Boswellia Extract, Boswellic Acids 243 mg, 100 Tabletsabout a week ago.  1 tablet twice a day with meals.  No difference.I then added Dr. Danielle's Turmeric a couple of days ago.  Started low with 1 pill once a day with a meal to help avoid stomach upset with the intent to increase it to 1 pill twice a day after a week.  To my surprise, after just 1 day, her limp was noticeably better.  Still there but much more mild than it's been these past several months.  She ran at the park yesterday so I was expecting her limp to flare up like it usually does after a hard run, but it is still only mild.The skeptic in me scoffs at the possibility that the turmeric could have made such an improvement--heck, ANY improvement, in just a day.  But I know what I see and there has been definite improvement.  So I'm increasing my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars for now and will continue to monitor to see if this is just an awesome coincidence.UPDATE 3 WEEKS LATER:I think I'm sold on this product.  My dog referenced above has still been running like a puppy.  Every time she does this at the park, I always expect her limp to get really bad later at night or the next morning.  But it never has.  The limp remains very mild, no matter how hard she plays.Also started giving this to my other senior dog.  He injured his front leg a little a few weeks ago and walked with a really bad limp for several days.  After giving him the turmeric with boswellia for about 3-4 days, the limp improved--although it also still flares up after a bout of running.I also took this myself for a couple of weeks.  I have something going on with my left hip.  It comes and goes and is some sort of muscle tightness, I think, caused by bad posture.  It's been creeping up on me for the past couple of months until finally it got bad enough that I really had to be careful about how I moved and bent to avoid straining my back, as I have in the past.  It was also painful whenever I walked.  I was at this point for about 2 weeks.  Finally took 1 pill 3x day, along with boswellia, and within 1.5 days, I felt the pain decrease. I can still feel a minor issue at my hip, but I wouldn't really call it pain anymore.  I stopped taking the turmeric after about a week but will go back when I have any other pain.I'm not ruling out coincidence completely, but with the experiences of my 2 dogs as well as myself combined, I think I can say with confidence that the turmeric has definitely helped.  It's pretty rare to notice an actual improvement with any supplements so I'm very impressed.RETRACTION: I previously wrote that the company offers a free bottle for positive reviews. But after reading a comment left to my review, I went back and reread the email the company sent and realized I had misinterpreted.  The company offers a free bottle for ANY review, but does ask that you contact them if you have less than a 5-star experience (no, I haven't contacted them yet because my experience may change over time, and no, I've not requested a free bottle--yet :)  So, sorry Dr. Danielle's Company for the unfounded criticism and thank you, Abbiegail Davy, for putting me straight.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2014", "summary": "Using with Boswellia & Working for Me and My 2 Senior Dogs"}

But most importantly, I was hoping to find another healthy yet tasty snack to have on-hand at work, and it seemed like these semi-new Quaker Stila bars could fit the bill with their Nutra-Grain Bar-like approach. And, expecting something like what is pictured and promised on the cover, I requested the bars.I wasn't really sure what to think when I got them. Everything seemed fine at first glance -the nutrition facts matched up with what precisely was promised, but I feel like the \"healthy\" aspect of the bars were a little exaggerated and it was implied on the cover that these bars are healthier than they actually are. While they may only be 100 calories per bar and have 0 trans fats, they are packed with super-high levels of sodium and have very few beneficial things, like vitamins or fiber.Then, when I bit into the bar itself, my very neutral expectations were immediately destroyed. These things are disgusting. They taste like cardboard and have absolutely no substance. The photo on the label implies that there is a solid layer of fruit filling, but once I bit into the \"cookie\" bar, I was left thinking \"Where's the fruit?\" The thin layer of strawberry flavoring is virtually non-existent and I felt like I was eating a hollow shell that tasted like cardboard. I'm not sure if Quaker is convinced that something \"healthy\" has to taste gross, because they completely nail that concept here.These bars have no redeeming qualities -they taste terrible, the fruit filling is so thin that it's an afterthought, and the bars themselves are so small that they don't really make for a satisfying snack. I'd have to eat 2-3 in one sitting to get something substantial, and I'm a small person. By then, I would have consumed 200-300 calories in just one snack, much more than the label implies. Not really \"healthy\" and certainly not enjoyable.I had to force myself to eat just one bar for the sake of this review.

Ever since I picked up a honey crisp at the Hastings (NY) farmer's market I have wondered how I could have been so oblivious to apples ;)  While I grew up in NY, I now live in Hawaii, far far away from apple country.  I have a kid who has always been huge on apples and apple products, and I am big on avoiding chemicals, pesticides, and anything else which is not especially good for us. Up to this point our favorite has beenSeneca Cinnamon Apple Chips,.7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 60)though when I noticed that there was sugar in it (not very much, actually) I went looking for something without.  I tried several brands and found some too tough, some too light, and finally came acrossBare Fruit 100% Organic Cinnamon Apple Chips, 14-Ouncewhich I find almost as good in terms of taste and texture, and about as good as you can get nutritionally.I triedPeeled Snacks Organic Apple Clusters, Cinnamon Crunch, 60 Gramthinking they would be much like the Seneca based on the manufacturer's description.  When I tasted them I thought it was something l;ike a \"rice crispy treat\" albeit flavored with something like concentrated cider: not bad, but very very sweet.  I looked at the ingredients and saw 10 grams of sugar/ serving and thought... that's not so bad, so why did it seem so sweet to me, and then I took a closer look, and saw that that was per 15 gram servicng.  15 grams! (note, that is 1/4 of the 2 oz package!  It is 2/3 sugar!!  I sincerely doubt you will find a candy, other than rock candy or cotton candy which has such a high percentage of sugar.  That said, just for fun I did a little comparison.This past Sunday my son deferred from breakfast, saying he had already had it.  O.K. , once a year he can do this (he's skinny as a rail, no weight problems here).... so I pulled up the information, and... will let it speak for itself:Cadbury Chocolate BunnyServing Size 1 pc (40.0 g)Amount Per ServingCalories 210Calories from Fat 108% Daily Value*Total Fat 12.0g 18%Saturated Fat 7.0g  35%Cholesterol  10mg 3%Sodium 40mg 2%Total Carbohydrates 23.0g 8%Dietary Fiber  1.0g 4%Sugars 21.0gProtein  3.0gPeeled Apple clustersserving size 15 gramssaturated fat 0trans fat 0cholesterol 0sodium 0fiber 2 gsugars 10 gSo that we are comparing apples to apples, per 10 gram \"serving,\" the Cadbury bunny has 5 grams of sugar, the apple clusters roughly 7 (.67), so Peeled Snacks Apple Clusters have half again as much sugar by weight as your average chocolate bunny.  Is it off base to call these candy?Other than that, I like that the ingredients are wholesome; no chemicals or otherwise unidentifiable ingredients, BUT know that these are mostly (2/3) sugar and treat them accordingly.  For me, that means more or less banishing them from my house.  I like sugar as much as the next person... BUT my personal strategy is to treat indulgences as just that, so I would personally rather have the chocolate and say that I, or the kids, have had our desert, treat... whatever, than to treat a product which is 2/3 sugar as if it were food.  Again, they are made from wholesome natural ingredients.  I just thought I would point out to whoever is watching their weight, has dietary concerns related to sugar, or is watching out for someone else... that these have an awful lot of sugar.  That said, I am off to reup my subscription to bare fruit for myself, and get a box of the Seneca chips for the kids.I am aware of a recent study which showed how food producers twist facts to make their products look healthier by tweaking the serving size.  How realistic is 1/2 oz of fruit as a snack?  If it were a piece of candy, maybe.  If a serving size is 1/4 of the 2 oz package, why to they not either package it in 1/2 oz bags or call out on the front of the package that you are getting 4 servings in that little bag?  In any case, I find it misleading in the extreme.  I like that it is made with natural ingredients.  I do not like misleading labeling, particularly when it is something which could cause serious problems for people with diabetes.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2013", "summary": "It's actually candy"}

It is easy to tear open the stick and pour out the coffee making this a convenient low mess option unless you also need to carry creamer and sugar.  Keep in mind that that the sticks are sized for a six oz cup rather than a 12 oz mug.An interesting concept would be to offer an assortment of flavored and non flavored regular and decaff coffees that a host could offer to guests for example. In my case I don't see any need to have 160 mini packs of the same instant coffee that I can buy in a canister.While slightly more expensive I recommend the more convenient packaging format for this product of 24 packages of 6-sticks each (144 total) since these  smaller boxes are easier to pack in a suitcase, pocket, purse or backpack or give as a nominal gift to a friend.Nescafe Taster's Choice Instant Coffee, Decaffeinated,  6-Count Single Sticks (Pack of 24)", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "07 31, 2008", "summary": "Counting the Cost of Convenience"}

I've had things that had a bit more interesting flavors to them, but this one is a bit bland/mild tasting.  It's not terrible or anything though, just that I felt like the passion fruit maybe could've been a little stronger.  As for the green tea, I could hardly tell this had green tea in it.  That's great for people who don't like green tea (like myself) but not so great if that was what you were wanting from it.  As for the aloe vera, I'm not sure it really had a flavor at all, as all the bits in here seem to have simply absorbed the flavor from the tea, and thus I can't tell what they would've originally tasted like.  Oh well, the whole thing isn't bad though.As for nutritional content, well, this is mostly sugar and it tastes like the green tea is pretty weak, so I can't pretend that it's terribly healthy or anything.  To be fair, though, the product never claimed to be a health drink.  So, would I recommend this?  Well, I don't know.

Other than price, it stacks up quite well to wheat spaghetti, though the taste is slightly different. My pasta-loving kids eat it happily and I can enjoy \"spaghetti night\" with them now. The texture is very good with either the normal or energy-saving cooking directions. However, I've found that there are a few things that make a difference in the final quality.First, regardless of which cooking method you use, after you add the pasta to the boiling water, STIR until you're sure all of the noodles are completely separated. If you don't separate them when you first add them to the boiling water, they might stick together and not cook properly. (This is true of wheat spaghetti, too, but the Tinkyada pasta seems a little more prone to it.) After they are all separate, you don't have to stir again if you're using the energy-saving method. With the normal method, I recommend a quick occasional stir to make sure none of the noodles are sticking to the bottom of the pot.Second, don't skimp on the rinsing. You'll see the water goes very cloudy when the pasta cooks - a lot of starch is being released into the water. You have to get that rinsed off or the pasta will stick together after you drain it. If you do the rinsing right, it won't stick together - even leftovers that have been refrigerated won't be sticky.  The cold water rinse seems to be particularly important. Since I like to serve spaghetti noodles hot, I start rinsing with cold water and then finish with hot water. The result is hot spaghetti with no stickiness.Third, unless you're on a low-sodium diet, I recommend salting the cooking water as directed on the package. Salting improves the taste (it's slightly sweet if you don't salt the cooking water) and it also seems to improve the texture slightly.About the energy-saving cooking method: This is great in the summer time since you can turn off the burner sooner and not dump as much heat into the house. But when it's time to rinse you may find that not only is the water very cloudy, but a skin of starch has developed on the surface of the water. It's not pretty, but it rinses right off.

I know that USDA Organic is a seal I look for and respect because the process to be able to be USDA Organic is extensive and I usually choose products with this seal for my family.I did not know about the other certifications so I had to look them up. CCOF Certified Organic stands for California Certified Organic Farmers and was the first organic certification entity in the U.S. The NON GMO Project Verified seal means that there are no genetically modified organisms used in the product. I did more research on NON GMO, because I was curious and found their website very helpful and interesting.Trying Coconut Oil out in the kitchen, I found that we will have to get used to the taste of it for saut&eacute;ed vegetables; it's not a bad taste, just different. As a family we have made other healthy changes that we had to get adjusted to and I think it will be just a matter of time and we will prefer coconut oil to all other oils.I originally only wanted to only try the Coconut Oil in cooking but I decided to give it a try on my hair too! As for hair care, I found coconut oil to be the perfect restorative mask! My hair is dry on the ends and tangles easily. The Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil really gave my hair a nice soft feeling. So needless to say, I'll be getting another container so that I can have one in the kitchen and one in the bathroom!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2013", "summary": "Unlimited Uses"}

You add a pound of ground beef to macaroni and seasoning, for a quick, tasty meal, but the similarities end there. Velveeta Cheesy skllets dinner kits have a package of creamy Velveeta cheese sauce right in the box, so the meal is much more creamier and cheesier. It comes in four varities, but I tried the Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac. Very easy to make and really tasty.  The box makes the directions very clear and concise and all you need to add is water and ground beef. I really think having the package of Velveeta cheese sauce makes a huge difference from other brands because it didnt turn out watered-down like some of this type of meal so. It was very rich and creamy.The seasoning pack gives it a little \"zing\", so it is more than just mac and cheese with meat. The box also suggests \"cutomizing: it with chopped tomatoes and lettuce. Although this sounds good, I prepared it the regular way.  I love to cook, but sometimes I come home from work and dont feel like preparing a big meal. Those are the days I like to have something easy to prepare. This was perfect and  because a package makes about 5 servings, so there was plenty left over. Very filling and satisfying, I would definitely buy it again. I could preapare it and divide into servings for several lunches during the week.

This is not your bland and blonde plastic honey bear honey; this is a richly flavored honey, dark and rich with character.  Add to the flavor the fact that it's organic and fair trade, and you've got a winning combination.An aside here: the first time I saw honey labeled as \"organic\", I immediately thought \"how do they do that??\", as honey bees can go several miles in any direction from their hives to collect nectar and pollen, so how could a beekeeper ensure they are harvesting only from organic crops?  The answer is \"they don't\".  The \"organic\" refers to the manner in which the hives themselves are managed.  This still has real benefits as today's beekeepers are finding it challenging to keep ahead of tracheal mite infestations, hive beetle incursions and the like.  An organically managed hive will NOT be treated with the chemicals used in conventional hives to control these pests, an advantage if you are looking to reduce your exposure to pesticides and toxic chemicals.The bottle even gets a thumbs-up!  It is designed to sit top-down, so then you're ready to pour honey, just pop the top, squeeze (the honey's already at the lid) and pour.  There is a small inner seal in the hole in the lid that stops the stream of honey as soon as pressure to the bottle is released; this is the most drip-free honey bottle I've ever used.  I'm almost down to the end of the bottle and there is no sticky residue on the outside, no sticky ring left on the countertop.  The bottle is so leak and drip-proof that, on a recent trip, I was able to toss the bottle in a cooler without worries.Great flavor, great packaging, organic and fair trade...short of having your own hives, this is a winner.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2013", "summary": "Excellent flavor and LOVE the bottle"}

Hmmm. . . Sound too good to be true?  Well, of course it is.  It's low-calorie because it's made with Sucralose (Splenda to the average consumer) and it promotes weight loss because its a combination stimulant (taurine) and diuretic - so basically, it works on your body like any over-the-counter diet pill.  That said, the Raspberry Acai flavor does taste pretty good, but it will be up to the individual to decide whether or not any potential benefit justifies the downside.Unlike many other reviewers, I actually liked the taste - I thought that it was a smooth blend of green tea and berry flavor.  However, there is just enough of that artificial tang at the end to tip you off that it's sweetened with Splenda.  But the absence of any fizz or overly harsh flavors made it easy to drink - which is good because it comes in full-size cans and leaves you feeling pretty full (i.e. just shy of bloated) afterward.So is it any energy drink or a diet aid?  It's a little of both.  Most of the crucial ingredients are lumped together into a single line item (i.e. their secret, proprietary mix), but taurine is listed and the caffeine content is obvious.  I found that while Celsius could beat back an afternoon energy swoon, it didn't really make me any more alert or focused - just instantly awake, albeit in semi-zombie form.  This effect came on quickly and did last for a couple of hours at least.Now for the bad news - the \"crash\" effect that a lot of these drinks try to pin on their competitors was overwhelming with Celsius.  As a little bit of background, I'm a grown adult in good health and am very caffeine-tolerant.  However, during my testing of this product, I made the mistake of drinking two cans about three hours apart and ended up unable avoid my first all-nighter since college.  I was completely awake and pretty functional throughout, although I wouldn't have operated any heavy machinery at the time.  But by the morning, I was suffering headaches, muscle twitches and even a flutter in my chest.  I'm completely sure that this was all temporary side effects of the outrageous amount of stimulants and not permanently harmful, but it was still enough to make me wary from that point on.So, the bottom line is this - if you're looking to occasionally avoid getting sleepy mid-afternoon at the office, or if you need to stay up late once in a while, Celsius may be an option for you to try.  As a prolonged weight-loss regimen, I wouldn't take on the potential health risks in order to grab at some too-good-to-be-true advertising come-on.

The \"Zinger\" teas by comparison can have a somewhat harsh finish.  If it were only about first impressions of taste, this would be a hands down five star product.  However, I have a couple of complaints about the packaging.  The tea bags are loose in the box with no container.  Once you open the shrink wrap, the flavor will decay fairly quickly as the box does not close tightly.  In addition, the is a small piece of tape or adhesive strip on the string attaching it to the tea bag and taking up the excess string.  I understand that this is to keep the loose bags from becoming a tangled mess.  However, wrapping each tea bag individually would solve all of the problems noted.  If Lipton would do this, they would have a true five star product.  Until then, they lose two stars.  I would only recommend this if you intend to use the entire box quickly.

I didn't notice what some other reviewers view as a disgusting appearance. Perhaps it is because my first experience with this product was a few years ago in a food sampling. Small cup, not a big plateful and I focused on the intense flavors, and the fact that the base is spinach -- something I love and don't consume enough.Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I adore this dish. The smell is distinctive -- decidedly earthy --which I relish. The paneer cheese is very light and soft with a texture like silken tofu, but the flavor is of a mild cheese. The cheese serves as a perfect counterpoint to the spicy spinach. Going against tradition I sometimes add a small amount of cooked brown rice, but I prefer the dish undiluted. And, I found the cheese chunks plentiful.The ingredients -- spinach, water, tomatoes, paneer cheese, onions, sunflower oil, salt, garlic, cornstarch, chilies, cumin are startling in their simplicity.

One said she would definitely eat it if she was hungry because it was natural, an attribute which others (including me) disagreed with.  They also couldn't agree whether they were nutritious or not, because they are low fat and high fiber.  In my mind they are empty-calorie carbo-bombs, with only 2 g of protein and 25g of carbs (3g sugar alcohols, beware; and 9g of fiber).

Second, the product is Rainforest Alliance Certified cacao. So the cacao is produced using sustainable growing techniques. These are the things about the product that I like best. And sometimes, it's these factors that make the difference between buying product A or B.As far as the taste ... well, it is not the best chocolate bar I have ever tried, nor is it the worst. First, the bar is about 7 mm thick ... moderately chunky as bars go. There is a classy-looking N emblem embossed in each piece. The nutritional panel says that one bar is a serving, but that one serving is going to provide about 330 calories ... actually 1/3 of a bar is a serving for me. The chocolate is not very melty. This is more common in higher cacao content chocolate bars; Newman's Own bar is about 54% cacao, so I was a little surprised. The bar was also a little sweeter than I expected. The chocolate was not unpleasant, but it just seemed to lack a \"smack your face\" slap of chocolate flavor that you expect in good dark chocolate.So, bottom line time: Newman's own is a decent but unremarkable chocolate bar.

That being said, I have to come out and say I just don't like these cashews, which are practically encrusted with salt and pepper.In our family we don't salt and pepper our food liberally, so maybe my wife and I were particularly sensitive to the salt-and-pepper blast of these cashews. Again, it's a matter of taste: if you love salt and pepper, you might like these.To write a fair review, I decided to wash the seasonings off the cashews under tap water to taste the bare nut underneath. I was surprised to find that the salt and pepper didn't just rinse off. Something was making it adhere to the cashews. So I soaked and rinsed and rubbed with my fingers a little more and finally got all the seasoning off the 5 or 6 cashews I had in my hand.Once I got all the seasoning off (or so I thought), I noticed something else that surprised me: the cashews were still greasy. This wasn't intended to be a whole-day affair, so I just popped two in my mouth. The first thing I noticed was that the cashew retained a slightly crisp, roasted character even after the drenching. That was the good news. Then I dropped the remaining cashews in my mouth, and a few seconds later came the bad news: I started tasting that pesky little prickly pepper picked for palate pop, poking its way through an otherwise tasty though plain roasted cashew.If you'd like a simpler review, my wife, a no-nonsense woman, ate just a couple and said, \"I hate these.

I love spicy things and the Poblano Chiles in this soup gave it a very nice kick that tasted incredible.

I could really taste the Smoked Gouda which was nice in a soup.  The soup was very rich and creamy.  There was a pretty decent amount of Red Pepper Chunks too.Spicy Chorizo & Pulled Chicken with Black Beans- I wasn't as big on this option as the other 2 that I've tried.  It's a bit thicker and although I do like Black Beans, the flavor of the liquid was a bit overwhelming with the black bean flavoring.  The meats were good but the black bean flavor kinda overpowered it.  Wasn't bad, just wasn't one I'll be getting again.The Pouch- I really like the Microwavable Pouch that the soups comes in.

Case \"InquiringMind\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "unixReviewTime": 1372291200, "reviewText": "Twenty years ago, my husband and I took a fabulous one-week Backroads' bicycling vacation through Louisiana. That's where we first learned about Community Coffee. It was the brand that the luxury bed-and-breakfast inns were serving and those where the incredible inns where we were staying. I remember the trip vividly and I also remember the coffee: the intense arresting aroma and the bold smooth strong taste. I can still conjure up the marvelous sensation of getting up in the morning in one of those charming B&Bs--each; one oozing with Southern hospitality and charm--and finding a steaming cup of Community Coffee waiting for us. It became the special ritual that I anticipated every morning. That was Cajun country, so I'm pretty certain that the blend was French Roast. I remembered it as very dark, rich, complex, and fabulously smooth...incredibly satisfying. It was just what I craved to put the perfect start on a day of invigorating and adventurous bicycle touring. So recently, when Amazon gave me the chance to receive a free sample of Community Coffee French Roast to test and review, I really jumped at it!Did the coffee from Amazon match my memory? Would I buy it on my own? Unfortunately, the present experience of drinking this coffee was not as magnificent as my memory; I wouldn't buy this now. It is not that this coffee isn't good. In fact, for ground, packaged coffee, it is pretty good, far better than you'd find in many upscale restaurants. The reason why we wouldn't buy it now is that my husband and my tastes in coffee have become far more discerning in the ensuing years. Now we buy our coffee as whole beans, in small batches from special local roasters, and we grind it ourselves. You can't beat that with any type of prepackaged ground coffee no matter how good.But that gets me to the topic of freshness. Each of these packages of Community Coffee comes in a very large 32 oz (2 lbs) bag. It's a premium bag, easy to open and reseal, and obviously well constructed to maintain freshness (in fact, these bags have special freshness valves that keep oxygen from entering the bag but allow interior pressure to be released). The problem is, if you read the FAQ section on the Community Coffee website, they make it very clear that you should use their ground coffees within two weeks of opening. There is also a \"use by\" date stamp on each package (in the case of the batch I received, that date was 65 days later). If you value freshness in coffee (and personally I think this is extremely important), before you buy these large packages, be sure your family's coffee drinking habits are big enough to drink all that large amount of coffee within the recommended freshness limits.In summary, this is a decent, medium-ground, French Roast coffee. If you're in the market for a full-bodied coffee, with medium acidity, and a dark color but not a burnt taste, I would definitely recommend this brand.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2013", "summary": "Very good, but not as good as my memory of it from Louisiana!"}

Don't go crazy on the price and keep it under ten bucks for a bottle max.  Step it up from there if you think it will affect you dishes.

I got high quality in this snack cracker, but only to a certain degree.  This box contains only 6 servings.  Each sleeve has one long sandwich type cracker with a soft sharp cheddar cheese spread in the middle of two very crisp multigrain crackers.  I wonder why the decision was made to leave these in one long cracker instead of cutting them in half?  Because the cracker is so crisp and because the cheese center is soft, when I bit into the cracker the other end came apart and separated.  Perhaps I should have been holding it down at the end.  The cheese does have a very pronounced cheese flavor, not necessarily sharp cheddar, but definitely a good cheese taste.  The cracker was very crisp, almost a little too much so, but once I began chewing it the whole cracker came apart in my mouth and separated into a not very pleasant sandy, dry consistency.  Have a drink handy when you snack on these because the cracker was rather dry when eaten by itself.Taking into account that there are only six servings of snack crackers in this box and each one is supposed to be an entire snack I found the calorie count of 130 each (with 60 of those calories from fat) to be rather high.  I didn't notice this snack being particularly filling so I think people will be likely to eat more than one at a time and that calorie count can really add up.  The package states they are an excellent source of fiber, 20% of the daily requirement as stated on the label.  The label also says the cheese is \"real\" cheese which is nice to know.  One statement I found a little strange is when the description says:  Crackerfuls, Multigrain, Sharp Cheddar, Natural Flavor With Other Natural Flavors.  Obviously I don't speak \"product\" because I have no idea what that is supposed to mean.All in all, this will probably not be added to my list of favorite Nabisco products.  I did not like the feel of the cracker in my mouth when I was chewing it, but the cheese had a nice cheesy flavor.

(It's worth pointing out that the bag was in a hot car before I tried some, but I still had this problem even after it cooled to room temperature.)The granola itself is a bit dry, unlike more honey coated brands, and the pieces don't stick together that well. So, after the big chunks are gone, you're left with lots of tiny bits that are messy to pick up. I suppose this wouldn't be a problem if you like your granola in cereal or yogurt, instead of trail mix.Even though it's healthy, I wouldn't recommend this product (or any granola) for mindless snacking.

Normally I eat the Quaker oatmeal that comes in packets and, even though I think it has way too much sugar, it's very good (the sugar is probably the reason I like it so much, duh). I thought this oatmeal sounded interesting, particularly since I really like pistachio nuts and cherries (but wow, what a weird combination for someone to think of--yes?). I will say, I really miss the old fashioned oatmeal that I ate as a kid, slow cooked and covered in butter. Yum. I probably should go back to that.Anyway, I only got one sample form the Vine, so I have to base my review on one try. (I probably will buy more and try it again, however.) I found that cooking it was simple enough--add boiling water and wait three minutes. There is a line in the cup and you add water to that line. I stirred it after I initially added water and the water level went down and so I added more and the only reason I even mention that is that I think if you don't add a second dollop of water, it will be a bit too thick.OK, texture and flavor: I really like the texture a great deal. I like to have something like nuts or raisins or whatever to chew in oatmeal. The pistachios pieces, slices of roasted almonds and cherries are plentiful. So they get great marks for both quantity and texture. Quaker did not cheap out with those ingredients, points for that.But the taste has a kind of, I don't know, a sort of flowery quality that I didn't particularly like--especially the liquid that is floating around in the oatmeal. I really really wanted to like this because the ingredients are a very nice combination. But there is something in the mix of sweeteners or whatever that is just a bit off. Try it though, you might like it. If I could, I would give it 3.5 stars--that's probably a more fair score. But since they were generous with nuts and cherries, I'm giving them 4.Anyway, bottom line: Very convenient, lots of texture and more than enough chewy stuff, but the flavor seems a bit off to me. I'll try it again though, maybe it will grow on me.Lastly, however, I think this stuff is way overpriced. It's more than $2 per serving--compare that to the basic packets (yes, much less in the way of added ingredients, I know) that sells for under $3 for 10 packets. Maybe they should just sell this stuff in simple packets and skip the expensive self-cooking cup.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2013", "summary": "Love the texture, the flavor is so-so at best"}

It smelled like apples, too much like apples, like being under an apple tree on a hot day, the ripe, too sweet smell of the apples that have fallen to the ground and begun rot mixing with the sharp crisp odor of the still green apples hanging on the tree, so overwhelming.I've made my own instant oatmeal, I found a recipe for it years ago on a running blog.  The basic recipe is instant oats, instant dry milk powder plus whatever dried fruit, nuts, spices and sugar you care to add. You mix it up and whenever you want a bowl of oaty goodness you scoop some out and add boiling water, done!Dried apple and walnuts were my favorite add ins, so the smell of apples and nuts heating is a welcome and familiar scent, but this oatmeal just smelled weird.  Unnatural.  The taste was strange too, a little bit sweet and tangy.I ate just half of the container and couldn't entice anyone else in my family to give it a try.  My hubby said it smelled like kool-aid!On the upside, I liked the ease of making it, the consistency was nice (though I didn't add nearly as much water as recommended, it would have been watery if I had, blech!).Anyways, this product is a real miss with me.

To get it out of the plastic interior pouch, I have to cut the pouch open and scrape it down with a spatula to get all the product out. And because it has separated, it needs to be heated or melted in order to emulsify it. This isn't a big deal when I'm using the whole package for something, but if I only want to use part of it, the remainder has to go into a storage container in the fridge, where it separates once again. I'm not sure how many times it is ok to reheat this product.Again, I believe this is just the nature of creamed coconut without additives in it, so I'm saying all that just so people know how the product behaves.

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!* Pike Place + Colombian + French Roast + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.The Colombian was the Best of the lot, then the French Roast, that is if you like a BOLD taste.Read my comments, after each bullet item:* Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig \"Brew\" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.* Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.* Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!* Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?* Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!Stay Tuned!", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2012", "summary": "A Better Brew for Flavor!"}

I haven't tried a single one I don't like.  Not only are they a much healthier alternative to the normal grocery store fare, I also think that they taste better.  Whenever I bite into an Annie's product, my first thought tends to be, \"Oh, so this is how it's supposed to taste.\"I first picked up a box of these on a whim one day while out shopping with my 7-year-old and 18-month-old.  The little guy was hungry, so I opened the box to give him some and, soon enough, the entire family was walking through the aisles of the store, munching happily.  My daughter loves Goldfish and she also loves those faux-butter crackers, so she was thrilled with the combination of the buttery bunnies and the cheddar bunnies in this box.  The crackers have a nice, rich buttery flavor and a genuine cheesy zing.  The pretzels are also very tasty and shaped either like bunnies or like carrots, much to the amusement of both of my children (and, I confess, myself).  We were so hooked on these that I immediately looked for them on Amazon and set up a subscribe and save, which is also more economical than purchasing boxes at my local store.What I can't emphasize enough about Annie's products is that they are real food.

Instead of killing their customers with lethal amount of fat and sugar and calories in their traditional bulk-size packaging, now the industry has learned something that should been completely obvious but somehow overlooked: put the same stuff into smaller packages (100 calories seem to be the magic number), market them as dietary supplements, and charge folks more money for it. Don't get me wrong, I think it is a good idea -albeit not the most economical option for consumers-but at least people can snack more sensibly without killing themselves. This South Beach choco-covered soynuts is another welcoming addition to the line up of the 100-calorie snack options. They taste just like what you would expect soynuts covered with chocolate would taste. The nuts are crispy, neutral in taste, and reminiscent pinenuts. Soynuts, the same beans in edamame, are not salty or sweet naturally, which complements the intensity of the chocolate very well. However, if you don't like soynuts, perhaps you should get something else. Nutritionally, these snack packs are comparable to most others out there - average fat content (6G) and carb (9G). I expected more protein, considering the chocolate and the soynuts and all, but surprisingly there are only 3 grams of protein, so not something suitable for pre-workout snacking.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2008", "summary": "tasty, expexted nutritional contents, not a whole lot of protein"}

It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use \"natural flavors\" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called \"effervescent decaffeination\" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, \"Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness.\" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday.

It looks like little round fish eyes staring back at me. So I have started using this in combination with veggies instead of by itself.I fixed this particular couscous with zucchini (it IS that time of year) dressing up the zucchini and making the couscous into a full side dish for four (instead of the two listed on the package).I began by sauteing the couscous in butter while I set the water to boil. Once both were ready, I moved the couscous into the boiling water while I sauteed the zucchini in the same pan along with 1/2 onion.What I noticed when I was working with the couscous was that it had a wonderful garlic aroma, which later translated into a wonderful garlic flavoring. However, while it shows picture of parsley on the cover, they translate to little green dots of parsley in the couscous (the reason I gave it four stars).Anyway, once the couscous was cooked (12 minutes) and the zucchini was also nicely brown, I fluffed the couscous and mixed it into the frypan for a final saute before I served it along with the meat.Low calorie? Probably not. But very, very, nice. I did notice that after the first time, my husband is no longer trying the couscous with me. Too bad, just means more for me.

Many snacks do this. Like peanuts. Or popcorn. The idea is that since the products are from 'natural' sources, there is less control over the batch. But seriously - less than 300mg per serving? Give me a break. This gives no one trying to help themselves in this area any hope of control. It's almost like writing a blank check. To yourself. To state that your product's single serving falls less than the daily total max recommended is garbage. Read the label.B) The batches may be uneven in cholesterol, and they may avoid legal issues by setting it at the 'max'. But the uneven textures and flavors you may get (I consumed, along with family and friends, several cases of these over 2 years or so) don't add up, either. I had burnt tones, teeth-cracking textures at times.I used to love these chips, much as the majority of the reviews portray. I thought I was enjoying at the least a fair product, staying healthy, keeping the fat away. But - they are simply simple carbs with a little twist of fat that get you by in the place of their higher-fat brethren. In case you are not sure of where I stand, I am one of those people who think carb-laden chips are not a great food. You don't miss health until you lose it. These chips will not help your health. They might, at best, make it slightly less worse than everyday chips - at twice or more the price.A leading non-profit consumer org concluded this was 'junk health food'. They cited other causes, as well. I wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food. It is a junk food that is masquerading as one.ADDENDUM:Just got around to adding this.

Please note it is not sold as organic, if you care about that.I wanted to discover its basic flavor and confess I cooked it in a variable temperature crockpot with a pork roast. In this case, I rinsed the rice prior to adding it to the roast and liquid, and had salted the water lightly. I noticed even while rinsing it, that it possessed a great aroma, which continued to manifest during the cooking process. And: FLAVOR manifested during the eating process!You may want to know that the coloring of black rice is so strong that it can and will stain white porcelain-type cooking vessels. Mine are Corning Cookmates and have been used for almost 40 years now (by my father before me) and have acquired a network of fine scratches, so it makes sense that a strong dye can enter. I will eventually bleach out the stain but couldn't get it with baking soda, which is my usual solution. So for this batch I used a slow-cooker with a black ceramic insert; that solved it.The grains are smaller than I am used to with the Lundberg brand. Thus I had to use a finer-mesh strainer for washing, as too many fell through my regular strainer. No big problem; just thought I'd pass on the info. I also would mention another aspect so you won't be surprised: If a few grains are scattered about, they will look precisely like small mouse turds. This was initially unnerving to me because I've been unable to catch some particularly small rodents (they may be shrews or voles) that are leaving this type of calling card, because they are too light to trip the traps.

To my palate, the almonds dominate the mix too much.The texture of the bars is somewhat tough and chewy, again not as appealing as the vanilla caramel bars.On the positive side, the bar is supposed to be packed with protein and fiber, it's gluten-free (and glutton-free, too, as I doubt most folks will hunger for seconds).  The product is also priced reasonably compared to many similar snack bars.So if you're looking for a healthy snack bar that's reasonably priced -- and you really like nuts -- you may want to try this product.  Those who aren't nuts for nuts will probably prefer the company's vanilla caramel bars with similar nutrition claims and IMO better flavor and texture.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2013", "summary": "Nuts"}

Blue Sky contains 10mg of sodium and the taste of sodium was the missing link between a real egg cream and Blah. Along with whole milk and U-Bet Chocolate Syrup, I now have the complete recipe for a perfect egg cream, and it tastes like heaven. Sure I could nit-pick and complain that the carbonation doesn't fully rival that of the old bottled seltzer. But each can of Blue Sky contains enough fizzy seltzer for two nice sized egg creams. I could always infuse Blue Sky with more carbonation with one of those CO2 siphon bottles, and that may provide the powerful first splash that provided the \"foam\" topping of the old school soda fountain egg creams. But Blue Sky gave me the prerequisite carbonation belch of satisfaction and that's good enough for me.

Each 1 cup serving is 240 calories and there's no MSG in the mix.Side Mates are distributed by Osem USA, whose site tells us that, \"The Osem Company is Israel's leading exporter of kosher food to the USA.

Seriously, in that era, most Americans didn't use a lot of imported seasonings and spices. That gradually changed, of course, but my first encounter with saffron wasn't until 1971 on a trip to Spain - it was a big steaming bowl of paella. Then, about ten years ago, on his old Food Network show &#34;Good Eats,&#34; Alton Brown gave a brief primer on saffron (you can find it on YouTube). So when Mehr Saffron offered me some samples of their saffron products, I was agreeable to trying it.My wife and I made one of our favorite home-cooked meals - chicken tikka masala with basmati rice. We used a Bobby Flay recipe for the chicken, and the Mahatma basmati rice was boiled. We used a &#34;pinch&#34; of the saffron threads (it would be approximately 1/8 teaspoon), and we steeped it in hot water for 15-20 minutes to let it infuse the water before adding the water, butter, and salt to the pot with the rice.The rice came out a nice golden yellow color and was very tasty. Basmati rice already has a certain natural fragrance, and with the added saffron, the rice was very savory, not at all like the bland rice that I grew up eating.In his TV show, I remember Alton Brown emphasizing that saffron should be fresh, and that it should be purchased from a specialty dealer, not a supermarket where it may have sat on a shelf for months. The Mehr Saffron saffron threads had a noticeably pungent aroma that I've read is a sign of freshness. Also, the saffron threads were all a deep red color, with no yellow threads that are a lower quality.I'm not a big Dr. Oz fan, but when I was looking for information on saffron, I found a video of one of his shows that featured &#34;The Best Herbs for Your Health.&#34; The first herb that he described was saffron, which Dr. Oz claimed was a powerful cancer fighter.So after I learned a lot about saffron and tried it in cooking, is it worth the cost? In my opinion, yes, but everyone will have to decide for themselves. One thing, though: A little bit of saffron goes a long way, so it's not as expensive as it may appear.A product sample was provided by the seller for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2013", "summary": "Adds a distinctive taste and color to food"}

Here are a few to start:*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberriesRegardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good.  My girlfriend and I make a big pot of \"steel cut\" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of chia seeds, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it.  Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace.  One of the primary contributors to their physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds.  I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia seeds, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price.Buy some Chia seeds and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2011", "summary": "#1 superfood"}

The latest package from \"discount tommy\" (a seller that recently changed names to something else), smelled really bad and musty.  Despite this, I decided to make a batch anyway; bad mistake, it tasted as bad as it smelled. I couldn't eat popcorn for a month because of how badly it tasted.I would not recommend this popcorn to anyone, and will not be buying it again. It's a shame, because it is priced right, but I would never gamble again with what to expect from this company; 2/3 chances of getting bad popcorn is not good odds.

I don't have jelly and I prefer crunchy to smooth. This rich and powerful gourmet peanut butter was not to my liking, however, most likely because it seems to try so hard to not be peanut butter....if that makes sense. To be fair, I am not a fan of peanut butter flavored anything (candy, ice cream) or even pb sandwiches with other items (bananas, marshmallow fluff, etc.), so perhaps I am not the target audience for this product. Please take this into consideration when reading my review.Many have complained of the smell, an overwhelming, almost wince-inducing blast of funk and raspberries. It's enough to put one off before they even get a chance to taste it. Then again, I've heard that durian fruit is really good even though it stinks to high heaven, so I took the dive.The taste is simply too much of too many things that are good alone but not in this combination. The richness and array of strong flavors lends itself more to a unique dessert than a sandwich spread. Perhaps it might be good out of the freezer or as a substitute for peanut butter in a recipe, I don't know.  I got it for sandwiches.Additionally, as also previously noted by many, the thickness makes it unwieldy and there is a peculiar lingering sensation in your mouth after eating it.

The sauce is in a pouch and you leave it in the package, snipping one corner, before you heat in a microwave for 90 seconds and let it sit for a minute more.I was happy to see real chunks of tomato and specks of basil, promising in a Crushed Tomato and Basil Sauce.Most of the testers said the sauce was \"good\". One person ate a few bites and said \"I'm already bored\". Many of the testers noted this sauce needs a lot of cheese to make it exciting. And many more noted it tasted acidic.One of my co-workers, who is very health conscious, looked at the list of ingredients and was very impressed. No chemicals, no preservatives.

But more seemed ready to use the sauce in say a chicken parmesan or a lasagna, a dish where you were adding something else to it.Personally, I love to cook so much it isn't a big problem to cook up a big pot of a simple sauce and freeze it in smaller portions for use in pasta, chicken parmesan or lasagna. I probably would not use this sauce again, because it is acidic and it just doesn't have the flavor of a homemade sauce, although it is closer than a run of the mill bottled sauce.But for people who are pressed for time, I can see the need for a product like this, to help speed up the process of making a more complicated dish.

Having previously tried and enjoyed Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea, I discovered that Bigelow had another  variety called \"Spiced Chai.\" I looked to see what blend of spices it had, but found only the following: Black Tea, Spices, Natural Flavors. This further peaked my curiousity. I bought a box and eagerly awaited my first cup. I prepared it in the traditional Indian way, slowly took my first sip savoring the flavorful and tasty blend of ...well... just exactly what blend of spices are in Bigelow Spiced Chia Tea?  Who can say for sure, but after visiting the Bigelow Tea Blog on the Bigelow website and reading a blog entry entitled \"The Mysteries of Chai Tea Revealed\" by Julie, I would say that it is likely a mix of black tea, ginger, cardamom, cloves, peppercorn, nutmeg and cinnamon.Here are the Bigelow directions for making chai tea:*Quick Method: Pour boiling water over one tea bag in a 6 - 8 oz cup or mug. Allow to steep 2 - 4 minutes. Add a dollop of milk and sweeten to taste. For iced Chai, prepare product hot with milk and sweetener - then pour over ice.*Authentic method: For each 8 oz cup, place one tea bag in a saucepan with 3/4 cup of water (6 fl oz) and 1/4 cup of milk (2 fl oz). Bring to a rolling boil, lower heat and simmer 2 - 4 minutes. Pour into cup(s) and sweeten with sugar or honey. Traditional Indian Chai is served quite sweet.I prefer to use vanilla flavored liquid coffee creamer in my Bigelow Chai Tea and I sweeten it with stevia packets.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2012", "summary": "Excellent blend of spices; RECIPE for traditional Indian chai tea"}

They've always been a staple in my household. As a child they were among my favorite breakfast food, and now my kiddies love them for an easy camping and outdoors snack. I purchased this collection when I saw how affordable they were, and how they offered up a nice variety- so each kid could have the kind they wanted.This big box comes with four smaller boxes inside. These boxes are your typical 'twelve count boxes' that you would by at a grocery store. There are two boxes of cherry, one of bluberry, and one of strawberry. The tarts themselves come in your typical poptart packages. Two tarts in one package. For children I find this serving to be a bit big. Toddlers and elementary aged kids will usually only eat one. But older kids and teenagers can easily eat two tarts (sometimes two packages!).For people unfamiliar with poptarts, they are basically fruit tarts with a very sugary pie crust. These tarts happen to have a frosting and sprinkles on them. Children love them, and as an adult I'll admit I crave them from time to time as well. The reason I rate these 4 stars is because I find them to be lacking filling. There are other brands of prepackaged fruit tarts that have a bit more filling, and that's something I really enjoy. Poptart brand has a thicker crust and a thinner filling, which I'm not the biggest fan of. Even so- all children seem to adore poptarts!Because they are 'non perishable' we like to take them on plane trips, camping, on picnics, and I also use them for daytime camp activities for local children. They are always a huge hit. I find that kids tend to prefer the blueberry and strawberry. Which kind of leaves me with a lot of leftover cherry- considering I recieve two boxes of cherry and other one of the other kinds. I, myself, am not a huge fan of cherry either. That's the only real downfall to this box.Other than that I think it's a great bulk buy. The boxes easily stack, which makes them easy to store away. And they're so delicious that I don't need to store them for long anyways. The poptarts came in good condition- no broken ones or crumbs.

I used about a teaspoon of coconut oil with about 1/2 cup of popcorn, and made it in the plastic microwave popper sold here on Amazon.  Just that 1/2 cup made a gigantic bowl of popcorn that was probably twice the amount you get in the typical microwave bags.  It makes you realize with a slap in the face how much you've been paying for so long, to get so little!  Doing it this way takes only about two minutes longer than the convenient bags, but you get twice as much at a very small fraction of the price!!Honestly, I am not wild about the coconut oil on the popcorn.  I will probably continue to use it, because of the health benefits of coconut oil, and maybe I'll get used to it in a short time.  If not, I'll consider using nothing or perhaps canola oil or light olive oil.  I just don't know if I can get used to that slightly coconut-y flavor on the popcorn.  And it does add a slight oily-ness too, that I'm not crazy about.  I like my popcorn dry and unsalted, or sometimes with just a tiny bit of sea salt.  If I find, as some have stated in reviews, that a little oil is necessary to get good pops, then perhaps I will spring for a jar of ghee in my local healthfood store. (For those who aren't familiar with ghee, it is clarified butter... they skim off the solids once the butter is melted.  It has a higher smoke point and is loaded with fat!  It is also pretty expensive, although you could make it yourself at home.)  At least the slight oily-ness would have a buttery flavor instead of one that really doesn't complement the popcorn, in my opinion.  I'm sure you could make an entire bowl of popcorn with about 1/8 of a teaspoon of ghee, so the high price and high fat content might be worth the taste.There were some unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl, but honestly not that many.  There weren't any \"half-popped\" ~ which I find yummy but they're probably not good for my digestive tract anyway, so I won't miss them.  If you compared the number of unpopped kernels in my bowl to what you'd find in two bags of commercial microwave popcorn, it would probably be about the same.  So I have nothing to complain about.The popcorn was yummy, and now that I have a truly organic, salt free, low fat snack that's full of fiber, I will be eating popcorn a lot more often.  I have stocked up on it, and when it's gone I'll stock up again.  I'd better be sure to also stock up on dental floss, otherwise my dentist might not be too happy with me at my next cleaning appointment.Thumbs up!!!(Slight warning on the plastic microwave bowl though... it gets EXTREMELY hot and stays hot for a while after you take it out of the microwave!  Use potholders to hold it, or you'll burn your hands like I did... I expected it to have cooled down a bit, but no...)Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 CupAddition January 2012:  I just ordered my second half dozen batch.  I finally figured out the perfect way to make this popcorn, and it has become a staple snack.  I keep the coconut in the fridge, and use a knife to shave off a few pieces to pop a bowl.  Perfect combo is 1/3 cup corn and a few shavings of oil... perfect bowl of popped corn!  The teaspoon I was using in the beginning was too much... that was why my batch was oily and too \"coconutty\" at first.  Just a few shavings is plenty to pop it, and gives it just a very slight coconut taste (which is delicious).", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2011", "summary": "Excellent popcorn!"}

The wafer has a decent crunch, reminiscent of most store bought sugar cookies.  In fact, that's what it most reminded me of.  It's like a plain sugar cookie with a hint of coconut.  The flavor was pleasant enough, without being particularly noteworthy.  Like a biscotti, I might choose to sample these with coffee or tea but I don't think I'd have the urge to devour them on their own.  I want something more decadently delicious to expend my calorie count on.  Final Call:  I'd eat one if it was presented to me, but I would not go out of my way to buy them.Lemon Cookie (3 1/2 Stars):  Unlike the coconut choice, the Lemon Cookie is a sandwich type with lemon filling.  The exterior cookies are rather hard and plain shortbread, but the lemon flavor is tasty.  From a texture standpoint, they reminded me of the generic brand of sandwich cookies you might get at a dollar store except filled with lemon.  Once again, though, there was nothing exceptional about them.  I liked them better due to the filling, and am much more likely to indulge.  But would I purchase them to eat a second time.  Sadly the answer is in the negative.

It's hard to think of anything else, even though comparisons are usually to be avoided in a review. Among other impressions were \"Better than a Thin Mint- not as minty\" which one taster seemed to think was an improvement.There is actually not much to give this away as an Oreo, the wafer is just that- a rather thin round of the eternal dark crust. A ridge runs around the edge to contain the mint filling. the fudge coating just about the right thickness, and unlike other non-dark chocolate, is not bad. The mint still tends to dominate, so exploring each component is slightly more difficult.I found the chocolate tended to leave a lingering taste in my mouth, not unpleasant, but not a characteristic I would think desirable in a cookie.If I am found with cookie in hand, it would usually be La Petite Ecolier, of course, in a class by itself.So, if you are fond of all things chocolate- especially minty ones usually peddled once a year by underage vendors in green attire- these may be perfect for you.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2011", "summary": "Hard to resist"}

Part of this could be because while it tastes like chocolate milk when it first hits your tongue, within seconds the flavor changes and you are left with an unpleasant aftertaste (though the chocolate flavor is better than the vanilla).Another issue I had with the drink is that while it provides all of these great nutrients, it is also high in calories.

I tried it the traditional route--as a hot cup o' java. I did not like it. Not this roast and not the Columbian (which was so weak, why bother).So, it's hot. It's summer. I normally hit Starbucks after the gym for my fave iced sugar free vanilla latte. I saw the ad for the iced coffee VIA, but it has sugar. I don't want sugar. So, it hit me, why not try making iced coffee from the regular VIA. (duh, should have thought of that sooner). I bought a 3-packer (like this one shown in image).It was amazing. 2% milk (about a cup), ice, Starbucks sugar free vanilla syrup (I buy it at my local Starbucks), in a blender bottle and shake, shake, shake. It comes out frothy and delicious. FOr me, I like it BETTER than my habitual 2 to 3x a week fix of it at the store. Because you add the VIA to the milk and the milk is cold and the instant coffee is not hot (like espresso), there is NO DILUTION. It makes for a much more flavorful, less watery, iced latte. OH MY GOSH SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.Now, my problem is not having three lattes a day, instead of three a week. Seriously. I'm a junkie now. (And I have coffee everyday, but my homebrew is so much better than Starbuck's that I don't get hot coffee there, I just used to like the convenience--still do--of grabbing a fast latte after exercising. I have a great coffee set-up at home with Paradise Roasters and Terroir gourmet single origins and a Technivorm and a Barratza burr grinder and filtered water pitcher, so really, now that I can make a fast latte at home and take it with me to the Pilates studio and put in the fridge there until I'm done, I may not be visiting the Starbucks as much, except to get my fave protein plate now and then and stock up on VIA.)The product is crazy overpriced. What...more than five bucks for what's 3 servings? How sick is that? Buy it at the store unless the price is dropped. That's crazy.But, nummy latte.So, if iced lattes are you vice of choice, might wanna consider this. And if you don't want sugar, skip the one they're pushing now in the blue packaging and buy the unsweetened.And I just slurped one after dinner (latte that is). Addictive. (Er, literally, I guess.) But at least I'm getting my calcium. :DThis price is much better than the other one I reviewed on Amazon (by another supplier). But I still think it's overpriced.

There are 12 snack-size bars (slightly larger than 1\" x 2\", 15g each), with 2 of each type of 6 flavors: 3 milk chocolates and 3 dark chocolates.  Each mini bar is scored into 12 tiny pieces for easy sharing or portion control.  The actual quantity of chocolate in the whole package is probably equivalent to 2 standard gourmet bars.  It bills itself as organic and Fair Trade Certified, and the product is made in Poland.  The back of the package has nutrition facts for each of the 6 flavors, and each mini bar is either 90 or 80 calories with 40 to 60 of those from fat.  I got one slipcase of these from Vine to review, and I'd expect to pay $6 to $10 for a single slipcase in a store.Milk: 34% cocoa, 80 cal, 40 from fat; this flavor was a good balance of sweetness and creaminess without venturing into sickly sweet or slimy.  I'd classify it as a better than average, but not fantastic, basic milk chocolate.Toffee-Milk: 34% cocoa, 80 cal, 40 from fat; this bar has a good buttery toffee aroma, and you can feel and see some toffee chunks, but the toffee flavor is not very strong.Almond-Milk: 37% cocoa, 90 cal, 50 from fat; I got a subtle almond aroma, there are many good-sized chips of almond visible in the bar, and the flavor is subtle, but definitely almondy.Dark: 70% cocoa, 90 cal, 60 from fat; the flavor of this bar has a distinct cherry note, and it's a good balance of creamy and chalky for a dark chocolate, with the right amount of bitterness.Ginger-Dark: 60% cocoa, 80 cal, 40 from fat; there are visible chunks of shredded ginger and a subtle ginger aroma with short, sharp bursts of ginger flavor when you directly hit a piece, but it's balanced well with the chocolate flavor and not overwhelming, pleasing even this reviewer, who's not a huge ginger fan.Cherry-Dark: 60% cocoa, 80 cal, 45 from fat; plenty of chunks of chewy dried tart cherries, good cherry aroma, but the flavor is almost too tart - they could have upped the sugar a bit to compensate for the very tart cherries.Overall, the chocolate is good, but not spectacular.  It would certainly make a good occasional treat or small gift.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2011", "summary": "Decent Gourmet Treat Perfect for Sharing"}

It is really refreshing and would be particularly great for hot summer days. One package is supposed to make a \"pitcher\" but my pitcher holds 16 cups of water, not 8. So, it took me two packages to make one pitcher. This makes it seem a little pricey since one container only makes 2.5 pitchers. At the current Amazon price ($22.40) that makes it $1.49 per pitcher. Not as cheap as Koolaid, but in my opinion it isn't a bad price for the unique (and adult) flavor that you can't get from any other sugar-free, non-alcoholic drink mix. Most of us would easily pay $1.49 for a 20oz sugary soda at a gas station.Speaking of alcohol, a little rum or even vodka goes great with this mix! I substituted some of the water out and tried it both ways. Yum!I think that most kids would like the taste of this Mojito Moctail mix also. It may be a great way to keep them from feeling left out when you are drinking real Mojito's (or you could spike yours and they would never know).

Because it is a mix of spices, there isn't one overpowering taste.  It's easy to pour, yet you don't have to use a huge amount to get good flavor.

A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste.  THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!When my order arrived the first thing that I did (after smelling it) was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar.  I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was.  I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice.  There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread.  Wonderful!  Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb.  I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.  My guests commented that I always seem to have a way with seasoning.  I thought about telling them that I was using a prepared mix but decided to simply agree with them.Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.  It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle. I've yet to use it as an ingredient in a marinade, but I think that it would make a quick, tasty addition to some of the liquids that I am now using to add flavor to chicken and beef.I am really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered the other two varieties (French and Napa) on my own.

Second, there's no stale date on it and thirdly it doesn't taste anywhere near as good, to us anyway, as the French Roast we get from Coffee Bean DirectFrench Roast, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag. The French Roast is a Subscribe & Save (old one so we get 15% off) for about 31 bucks for 5 lbs for about the same price as this item. That said, the French Roast is stronger and the beans are nice and dark. I see some have referenced Eight O'Clock in reviews and I can remember when that was A&P;'s store brand... for those from the East many years ago. At the current price of 13 bucks a pound it compares with the bulk coffees at the local food stores for about the same price. I went with 3 stars because I don't think it supports all those 5 star reviews and it's in the average range for flavor. My drip coffee maker has a robust setting and with that on this blend isn't near a great cup of Joe.Based on some comments from someone who won't accept that my coffee doesn't taste as good as theirs I'm adding a bit more to my review. I ordered on January 4, 2013 and the date on my bag was 120911 (September 11, 2012 using the YY/MM/DD format) and it was listed as \"New\" on Amazon. As you can see, it was past the date when it was sold. I'm not stating anything about freshness... just taste and that we don't think it's anywhere near a 5-Star bag of coffee. The date \"made no sense\" to me because I was unsure what it was (stale date, best by date or whatever) and I didn't think Horton's would want Amazon distributing their coffee past that date... but that does not seem to be the case. If you already like this coffee continue buying it. If you like to purchase coffee 4 months past the date on the bag then please do so. My review has nothing to do with what others think of this coffee so there's no need to be defensive. We have both been drinking coffee for over 50 years each so the rating is purely our impression of taste... and it wasn't good. Because of the recent comment I've lowered the rating to 2-Stars because it still tastes inferior to a 5-Star coffee, it was sold after the date on the bag and we will not brew it without mixing it with other blends to improve the taste. We do use a decent Melitta drip coffee maker with a stainless thermal carafe and no warmer plate to burn the coffee.This review is just our opinion of taste: not strength and not freshness... though it is bitter and that could be because it's not fresh... but I'm not making that claim. It just doesn't taste good and if it were stronger it still wouldn't taste good. If I add more grounds it doesn't taste any better... actually worse. It does not state in the description that this is a \"medium blend\" as mentioned by the commenter. If you can only get a medium blend from \"100% Arabica beans\" it doesn't matter because it still doesn't taste good... but Arabica beans should  deliver complex flavors and it's just not there in the bag we received 4 months after the date on it. We drink medium blends also and used the example we provided because it tastes better so I'll add another example of a coffee that tastes better because there's no shortage of examples. To prove our point... at least to ourselves... we purchased a container of Maxwell House French RoastMaxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)... a medium-dark with 100% Arabica beans... near the sell by date (on sale for under 7 bucks because of the date) and it tastes far superior to the Horton's. Also, the container is 33oz. so it comes out to under 4 bucks a pound. I'm not a fan of buying pre-packaged ground coffee at a food store but if I can do so and get something that tastes better than Horton's it really doesn't make much sense to buy the Horton's... in my opinion. I get that someone who has rated this coffee 4-stars likes it but others have reviewed it unfavorably and we still don't like it.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2013", "summary": "I'm not quit as impressed as others... and it was outdated."}

After a few generous sips, I found the can nearly drained.  I appreciate the fact that the entire drink clocks in at only 45 calories, making it perhaps the healthiest of all the commercially available cold coffee drinks.  I was also pleased to see that it uses beet sugar as a natural sweetener as opposed to corn syrup, and of course, all illy issimo drinks uses 100% Arabica coffee.  So, there's no denying the quality.But in short, this was not nearly as tasty or as satisfying as the Cappuccino I previously tried.  The Caffe was intense, slightly creamy, and just about as sweet as I would want it.  But it left me with a bitter, unpleasant aftertaste that lingered far too long.  You should not feel the sudden urge to brush your teeth or drink cold water after enjoying espresso, but that is exactly how I felt after finishing this.

The granulated form extends sucralose's uses to encompass all those in which sugar can be used. I have baked with it a couple of times, with good results; and it is especially convenient that it is formulated to substitute for sugar cup for cup, teaspoon for teaspoon. This obviously means that you prefer sugar in a sugar bowl rather than packets, you can use this just as you would regular sugar.The sucralose molecule is rather similar to that of actual sugar, which may account for the similarity of taste; but unlike sugar it contains virtually zero calories (note that \"zero calories\" does not mean \"no calories,\" but rather an amount less than 1 calorie per serving. It's not enough to worry about, and most diabetics can consume it safely in reasonable quantities.Sucralose is my favorite artificial sweetener, but it still falls a little short of the taste of real sugar. The only way I know to describe the difference is to say that it tastes a bit lightweight. I use it to sweeten iced tea and find that a small amount of honey adds substance to the sweetness. This product is a boon to calorie watchers and, in this form, to cooks as well. I would be remiss not to note, however, that at least one grocery chain sells its own version of granulated sucralose, which I have found indistinguishable from the Splenda product except for having a lower pricetag.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2009", "summary": "Versatile sweetener"}

(236g)For a change of pace, if you can find this next to the  Hormel Corned Beef Hash, give it a try. The can lists a serving size as 7   ounces, or half a can, but going by the 2  ounce or 1/3 of a can that I used for reviewing the Hormel Corned Beef Hash, you should be able to get six servings from a 15 ounce can. If you are camping, and the weather is bad, you can even sit in the tent and eat this Hormel Roast Beef Hash cold, straight from the can. Add a little Heinz Ketchup to make it taste more like a meal. At home, heat some up in a frying pan with an egg or two added.  Eggs are hard to cook in a microwave, as just before the yolk dries out, it may explode and makes a mess.  You need to keep the egg away from the corned beef, and cover the dinner cooking plate with plastic wrap to contain any egg explosions.The egg white will not cook if it is touching the hash, and will require more time added to the two minute (1:55 minutes?) cooking time in the microwave, and by that time the yolk is dried out. A frying pan on the stove is definitely a better and more manageable way to cook hash and eggs. Use a slice of butter and medium heat to keep the food from sticking to the pan, as even non-stick pans will eventually wear out and become ordinary pans.In comparing the Hormel Roast Beef Hash with the Hormel Corned Beef Hash, on a per serving basis, the Roast Beef Hash seems to be better for you:Serving Size 1 cup (236g), Servings Per Container about 2.Amount Per Serving: Hormel Roast Beef Hash----Hormel Corned Beef Hash.Calories.......................380................................380..Calories From Fat........220................................220Total Fat........................24g................................24g..Saturated Fat...............10g................................11g..Trans Fat......................1g..................................1gCholesterol....................70mg.............................80mgSodium.......................790mg............................990mgTotal Carbohydrate........22g.................................24g..Dietary Fiber................2g...................................2g..Sugars........................1g...................................1gProtein........................19g..................................16gPercent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet:..Vitamin A, Vitamin C.....0%..................................0%..Calcium.......................2%..................................2%..Iron..........................10%..................................8%Based on this chart, it would appear that the Roast Beef Hash is healthier, with less Cholesterol, less Sodium, less Carbohydrate, and more vegetable  Protein.

However, the size of the bag is deceiving for the amount of product inside. Although they are easy to open by simply tearing off the top inch, they are not resealable - not that you would want to because the servings are so 'small'. The bag design also makes it near to impossible to reach in by hand for snacks. Even a child's hand is too large, resulting in having to eat this snack by pouring into hand or bowl.2) At the bottom of each bag is a layer of fine 'powder' residue from the dried fruits. It gets on everything and stains: esp. when wet from fingers, etc. It also makes it difficult to get the last of the snacks from the bag to your mouth, esp. if eating directly from the package,  because the powder from the bottom of the bag puffs out, up your nose and all over your mouth. Makes a mess.3) All 3 flavors that I tried had the same issue as someone mentioned in their comments before me: each flavor seems to have an over-abundance of one particular fruit. In the Cherry Berry, it is apples. In the tropical, I found it to be mangoes, and in the orchard, it was bananas, lots and lots of bananas.4) I also found some of the snack to be 'crunchy' while other pieces of fruit were sticky/mushy once in my mouth. Ex. banana slices. The combo of moosh and crunch (very little crunch) was disappointing when this is suppose to be a 'crunchy snack'. I found myself using it up in yogurt and oatmeal rather than as a snack.This is a natural snack so the first time around I didn't mind the expense. However, now that I know what to expect, I will not purchase again unless the packaging and fruit 'dust' issues could be addressed. Then it might be worth the money. Until then, I'll buy my own fresh bananas, mangoes and apples.I will admit, however, a few of these put together in a gift basket would make a nice presentation for someone who has never tried this product.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2009", "summary": "Nice flavor, but..."}

I don't have $4 a day or an extra 15min even to rush over for some coffee so that is where Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte comes in hand. Make your own holiday classic out of the convenience of your own home, at work, or even in your car on the way to work as long as your aren't driving. It's that simple, and you can adjust the flavor to meet your needs instead of having to wait an extra 10min to send your drink back for them to fix it for you. All you need to do is boil water, or heat milk, and then add 4-5 teaspoons of latte, stir and you are done! That's it who knew a latte would be so simple to make. I prefer to make mine with milk with about 6 teaspoons (I prefer a stronger peppermint taste, but overall I would rate the peppermint flavor mild with only 4 teaspoons and the mocha very slight.) and add a little bit of caramel drizzle to go along with it. Takes me only 1 min to get my latte ready in the morning and I am out of the door, and the best part about the whole thing is that it didn't cost me $4 for a single cup.Other than convenience, I love the fact that you get foam on the top of your latte. I know lattes are supposed to have foam, but I can't tell you how many times I have bought make-it-yourself-lattes and their excuse for foam has been this pasty layer at the top. Maxwell House lattes have had a generous amount of foam on the top, much more than you would expect from something that you are just stirring into a cup.If your just like me and love your holiday coffee but don't have time and don't want to pay your coffee house prices I highly suggest you try Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte. And if you want an extra treat add a little bit of caramel to your drink, you can thank me later.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2011", "summary": "Holiday Classic"}

As a personal treat to myself, I slice bananas in a bowl, pour Anderson's Maple Syrup over them, put a dollop of real whipped cream on top, then pour a slight smidgen more maple syrup on top of the whipped cream.

Just how healthy is this ready-to-eat popcorn, and how does it compare with Smartfood?For a product promoting the Sharp White Cheddar aspect with glowing photos, there just isn't much of a cheddar flavor here. With the Smartfood popcorn, it tastes like real cheddar was layered over the popcorn, with that delicious, full flavor. Here it's as if some cheese-like flavoring was barely sprinkled on it. It barely tastes cheddary.It's not that it's bad, but more that it's \"mostly harmless\". When there is another option to choose from, it doesn't make sense to take this one instead, if cheddariness is your goal.So then, maybe this one is more nutritious?Unfortunately, no.With this Orville bag you get 1.5oz of popcorn. The Smartfood comes in a 1oz container. So the Smartfood is a better portion for portion control, and is still quite filling. That then also causes a significant skew in what you're ingesting. Here are the stats. In each pair the first number is the Orville number, and the second is the Smartfood number.Calories: 240 / 160Fat Calories: 140 / 90Total Fat: 16g / 10gSaturated Fat: 2g / 2gTrans Fat: 0g / 0gCholesterol: &lt;5g / &lt;5gSodium: 420mg / 290mgTotal Carbs: 21g / 14gFiber: 2g / 2gProtein: 3g / 3gSo you get just as much protein and fiber when eating the SmartFood popcorn. And you save yourself quite a lot on carbs, sodium, fat, and calories. In just about every way the SmartFood is the better choice.If the Orville Redenbacher was enormously tastier, then I might say it's worth the occasional splurge to have it instead. Just as I occasionally might eat a hot fudge sundae. But if the flavor isn't as good, *and* the health markers aren't as good, I'm not sure what my incentive would be to eat the Orville Redenbacher brand.All in all, I always recommend eating fresh foods vs packaged ones. So if you're going to \"splurge\" and have a treat for something like this, I'd say to make it worth it and go for the best tasting one you can get. In my opinion, that's the SmartFood choice.I was provided a sample of the Orville Redenbacher's Sharp White Cheddar popcorn from the Amazon Vine program, for the purpose of doing this review. That being said, we buy hundreds of food products for testing every year with our own money, and this comparison is one of many we've made in this product area.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2013", "summary": "Mostly Harmless"}

The bad news: The oil is unhealthy sunflower and hydrogenated soybean oil (trans-fat). While the amount of trans-fat is low, it's still there. There are also \"natural flavors\" which is corporate-advertising-speak for \"chemical flavoring\".

It's worth trying both to see which you prefer.-------I am hypoglycemic and used to eat Dreamfield's low-carb pasta, which is incredibly tasty, but I was still bloating and decided to go gluten-free with my diet a few months ago to see if that helped (it did). I had been eating Ancient Harvest's quinoa pasta, and while it tastes good with butter and salt, the texture is grainy and I didn't like it with spaghetti sauce. The shaped pasta like rotini also falls apart when it's cooked. The brown rice pasta I tried, which was touted as \"not mushy\" was exactly that, and so disgusting I tossed it after two bites. When Barilla's GF pasta became available through Vine, I decided to give it a try.When I cooked the Barilla GF penne pasta this weekend, I was pleasantly surprised. Great taste, great texture, tasted quite a bit like regular pasta. I happily inhaled the bowl! Like the other GF pastas, it still has a lot of carbs, more than I normally consume and considerably more than Dreamfield's. But I definitely liked the taste and texture better than the other GF pastas I've tried. No bloating or gastric distress. It's also less expensive than the boutique brands, and local grocery stores are offering lots of coupons for the Barilla GF pastas.However, when I had leftovers, the texture wasn't as good as it was when it was fresh. It was a little grainy and not as palatable, and I did not particularly enjoy it. It lost some of its flavor. I'd still recommend the Barilla, but would suggest you only make as much as you're going to eat at that time rather than making enough for leftovers.I discovered at the grocery store the other day that Ronzoni is also now offering a GF pasta and I bought a box of that.

Apple and Blackberry were both rather mild tasting; Clementine and Grapefruit a little stronger and more tart; and Pomegranate had the strongest taste.

The only difference between Izze in the cans and Izze in the bottles, other than the obvious of size and container, is that only Izze in the cans is fortified with vitamins: C, B6, and Niacin, plus the fact that currentlyIzze Sparkling Blueberry Soda (12 ounce)and Izze Sparkling Peach Soda (12 ounce) are only available in bottles.Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used.

The negatives are that you need to eat a handful or the popcorn is bland, if you eat it in small handfuls THEN it tastes sugary and sweet. The popcorn is also cold, coming right out of the microwave, I think this is due to it not really having any coating like butter so it gets cold fast......I like warm popcorn. It's also really light and dry.......I like buttery popcorn. All in all this popcorn is good tasting and I am really picky about this stuff and artificial sweeteners, it doesn't taste fake or chemical to me. Have you ever had a popcorn ball? It tastes like a less sweet version. I happen to love popcorn balls, some people don't.UPDATE: I only ate 1 bag of this stuff. It's gross.

It has a more complex mix of flavors that is more than just one note.  Most notably is the latte aspect that seems quite milky or creamy which is nice.  The actual coffee aspect (like most mixes like this) is minimal, but it does contain instance coffee (according to the ingredient list).  It is not a caffeine jolt like a strong coffee and does not taste of strong coffee, but I wouldn't expect that.  Between the sugar, fat, and small amount of coffee it is maybe a gentle boost.  It is a creamy mix of flavors that surround a pumpkin pie spice.  However both my wife and I would say we \"like\", not \"love\" this.  Still very good and happy to have it on occasion.The biggest drawback to me is the fat content, with a 10% DV of saturated fat (although only 3% DV total fat).  The 4% DV carbs (8g sugars) is okay in my book.  It makes me think twice about having a cup, and think about what else I was going to have that same day, and certainly not daily or multiple in a day.  So within moderation, one cup of this now and then around the Halloween & Thanksgiving holidays seems a nice treat.  It isn't terribly bad for you, but in my book cannot be ignored.  Of course check what your alternative was going to be, if your next choice was something using a creamer with equal or more fat content, then this consideration is a moot point.  But this is just based on the 1 1/3 tbsp serving size and you are likely to use a bit more.Do use the 4 teaspoons (or more) recommended for 6-8oz.  For 6oz, I found 4 to be ideal to taste great.  They don't clarify what kind of teaspoons, level or heaping, so I assume level or slightly rounded.  4 slightly rounded seems to yield a very good drink.  But I think it adds up to more than the serving size of 1 1/3 tbsp.  But you cannot really cut down to stretch the mix or lower the %DV.  We have tried 3 rounded tsp in 6oz on three occasions and always find it to be too watery and always needs that extra tsp.  If you are going to have 3, you really need to put in the 4th to make it worthwhile.I have to compare to a another pumpkin spice coffee that we think is heavenly.  We absolutely love theGreen Mountain Coffee Pumpkin Spice (K-Cups)mixed with 1 or 2 tbs of International Delight, fat free, french vanilla, coffee creamer, found in your refrigerator section of grocery stores.  The fat free version has 0% fat and 2% carbs per tbs.  I always use 2 tbs, so compared to a serving size of this, they are both 4% carbs, but I save the fat.  The pumpkin spice K-cup with this is just heavenly, but much more of a single note flavor that is the pumpkin pie spice and creamy in a simpler way.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2011", "summary": "Very Good, Complex, and Creamy Latte Quality"}

It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.  This item will probably fit best in the health niche market, and I don't see it hurting the sales of Sunkist any time soon.

When I searched for &#34;coconut oil&#34; in Amazon books, I got several thousand hits. It's definitely a hot topic these days, yet I can remember when the consumption of coconut oil was widely disparaged because of its saturated fat. Fast forward a few decades, and although some health authorities still don't like coconut oil, the tide has turned and the oil is being praised for its many benefits, both internal and external.The Viva Labs product is &#34;extra virgin.&#34; Since it hasn't been refined or heavily processed, it has a very mild coconut taste and aroma, both of which were very pleasant to my palate and nose. The melting temperature is about 76 F, so at most room temperatures, the oil has a soft creamy texture. I tried a spoonful, and it's quite tasty. I then fried some breaded shrimp in the oil, and it was delicious. I'm looking forward to substituting coconut oil for olive or canola oil in some of the recipes my wife and I use.Healthwise, because much of the saturated fat of extra virgin coconut oil is in the form of lauric acid, coconut oil is considered to be a better alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oils when solid fats are required. In addition, virgin coconut oil is composed mainly of medium-chain triglycerides (aka &#34;healthy fats&#34;), which may not carry the same risks as other saturated fats. Recent findings indicate that daily consumption of coconut oil may boost brain performance and could even help to prevent Alzheimer's.The two books on coconut oil that I reviewed also mentioned the external uses of the product for improving skin moisture and appearance, and for aromatherapy and massage therapy. It can even be used as a restorative treatment on hair.Coconut oil is definitely a hot product today, and my experience with the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has been very positive.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2013", "summary": "A healthy oil with a multitude of uses"}

This is a very crisp, refreshing beverage that has just the right balance of fruit to carbonation, and a slight tartness that keeps it from being cloying or flabby. Some reviewers have commented and even complained about this sparkling juice having only the barest amount of carbonation.  Not so with the ones I have tried, so perhaps these other reviewers left the top open and allowed it to go flat or something. Believe me, this had lively carbonation, and a good, natural tasting tart orange flavor.  The size of the can is convenient, too - takes up hardly any space in the fridge or in the lunch sack.As part of the \"Vine\" program, I received and tasted three different flavors but Amazon will not allow me to publish a separate review of each flavor.  So I am combining them all into one.Apple flavor: like biting into a crisp, green apple and savoring the peel and the fruit/meat at the same time. It has nice, clean and refreshing flavors with an excellent balance of carbonation. Normally I am not a fan of apple juice or sparkling cider but this one I liked.  It is not cloying or flabby-tasting as I find most apple beverages to be, probably because this is green and not red apple-flavored.Grapefruit flavor: this was my least favorite of the bunch, but if you prefer a very tart flavor, this fits the bill nicely. Again, a good balance of carbonation, crisp, and refreshing, this had good pink grapefruit taste but I also detected a plastic-tasting element.  The aftertaste was pure grapefruit so I don't know where that plastic came from or where it went, but it did mar an otherwise nice drinking experience.Overall I rate these Izze beverages very high.

It produces an amber-colored brew that lacks the crisp tannin flavors that should be in quality green tea. With the prominent drawing of Mount Fuji and distinctive Shinto torii (Itsukushima, a UNESCO world heritage site) on the box, you might think this is Japanese green tea. It is not. No information is listed on where it is grown, except that it is \"packaged and blended in the USA\".Green tea is very good for health because of the abundance of catechins and flavinoids (antioxidant compounds) and has half the caffeine of black tea. Good Japanese green tea produces tea that is clear pale yellow-green, or very dark green, depending on the tea grade. These helpful chemicals, however, get mostly destroyed during roasting. Catechins are also responsible for the bright aroma and astringent taste of green tea, which is lacking in this product. With its brown leaf particles (see my photo comparison in gallery) and resulting brown liquid, Bigelow is more like hojicha, a roasted green tea. The flavor is very thin and I have to use 2 bags per cup of tea.A much better quality tea isKirkland Signature Green Tea Matcha Blend, 100% Japanese Tea Leaves, which is surprisingly good for a tea sold in non-specialty supermarkets. It is made by Ito-En, one of Japan's biggest beverage makers. I first heard about it because it is the tea used by staff at the Japanese Embassy in DC.As for directions, the ideal temperature for green tea 70-80C, NOT boiling (100C) as the product description recommends.

With that being said, this is a difficult product to review because there is a lot of highly subjective personal opinion that goes into a reviewing an item like this.Basically, if you enjoy bottled, flavored iced tea beverages, then you'll probably enjoy this.  If you already hate Arizona iced tea or Lipton's flavored teas, this Celsius Raspberry Acai beverage is going to be no different.The flavor is very much akin to Arizona or Lipton raspberry flavored iced teas.  This Celsius product is a green tea with raspberry acai.  It is not carbonated and is not sugar sweetened.  I find just like the other companies' raspberry iced teas, the Celsius Raspberry Acai flavor starts out cool and smooth, but finishes with a somewhat tart harshness.  Myself, I've never been a big fan of that unsweetened or lightly sweetened ice tea flavor that finishes with the harsh ending.  The Celsius Raspberry Acai is drinkable, but I don't find myself craving another can at any point.  However,  I can see where some people find it to be undrinkable, likely due to the finishing flavor.  Still, it's nothing you haven't tasted before if you've had those other products.So what's the big deal with this Celsius brand of canned teas versus any others?  Well, the can boasts that drinking a 12 oz serving (10 calories) boosts your metabolism to burn off 100 calories.  Obviously there is no way I can support or dispute this claim as I have no way to measure my resting metabolic rate after drinking this stuff.  What I can say, though, is that there is 200  mg of caffeine per can.  You can compare that to 12 oz of coffee which I think is usually somewhere around 120-150 mg of caffeine, depending on brand and type.  The last couple of days I've substituted my 11am cup of coffee with a Celsius can and I get the same level of pick-me-up as the coffee.  So, I can vouch for the added alertness and energy boost.  As far as burning 100 calories after drinking it? I honestly don't know.  That comes back to personal opinion and whether or not you believe all the acai diet hype with adding \"meta-blends\" of taurine and guarana and ginger extracts, etc.  I have to leave that up to you to decide as I'm not a nutritionist and have had little experience with similar products.Overall, I personally give it 3 stars because I find it to be drinkable (though I don't LOVE it) and it gives me a comparable lift as a cup of coffee, but I don't know if I personally believe all the energy burning claims.  If you enjoy other brands of iced, raspberry flavored teas and you're into the calorie burning claims of acai/herbal blends, then I would definitely recommend you try this stuff.  If you already know that you don't like green or raspberry flavored iced teas, you'll have a hard time swallowing a can of this.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2010", "summary": "An alternative to a cup of coffee IF you like raspberry iced teas"}

It also contains ALA Omega-3, which is a fatty acid that promotes heart health.Mainly, I was concerned with how the pasta tasted, which was wonderful.  I could have eaten these noodles by themselves.  Instead, I served them with Ragu Chunky Mushroom & Green Pepper Pasta Sauce (Ragu Chunky Mushroom & Green Pepper Pasta Sauce 26oz) that had been heated together with a pound of ground turkey meat fried in a skillet.  (I substitute ground turkey for ground beef when I cook a lot of meals.)

I thought it would be tea leaves mixed with peppermint.  It worked out in my favor, though, because I like that this is caffeine free.The taste is a mild mint flavor.  I've chewed peppermint gum for many years, several pieces a day usually, and this is nothing like that or peppermint candy.  It's a much milder taste to me, but still quite enjoyable and refreshing.  I've had a few cups unsweetened, and some cups sweetened with various substances (including agave nectar and erythritol), and they've all been good.The pyramid bags are pretty cool and \"classier\" than normal bags.  Like another reviewer (Wandrwoman) mentioned, it would be nice if these were in a sealed container, but that reviewer also mentioned just using a zip lock bag (which is a great idea).I absolutely recommend giving this a try if you like peppermint, but like any food product, I also generally recommend that you see if a local store has these in a smaller pack if it's your first time trying it (versus buying six 18-count boxes all at once).

Yes, two drops from this container equal one packet of splenda?

Okey, that aside let's go to the part in the title of my review where I also say: It works! I tried it in my regular daily coffee and must say the taste is very agreeable and I compare it mostly to Splenda (which has been the choice for the past year or more) and it certainly is as good, if not better. No weird taste that I been able to tell and with the added bonus that it has zero zero zero, I think it makes a strong case for consumption. Heard that Splenda does have carbs and calories compared with this EZ-Sweetz. So I like it and now I am trying to see how long will it last compared to the price it cost to buy it. And since it has no impact whatsoever in the glycemic index (don't I sound very informed?) that is a plus to be considered. Perhaps is not even expensive if it lasts for at least a month or more. I found the product by accident and intriguing from the gate go so I was running low on Splenda and instead of going back to Costco and purchasing another 1000 packets I bought this one. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is for the value factor but in everything else that it is supposed to do, it does with shinning colors. Thankful to the fine, and I mean fine, reviewers in amazon which I have learned to value and trust their helpful opinions (most of the time, anywhoo) and who knew EZ-Sweetz (2oz - Liquid Sweetener 800 Servings/Bottle) existed in the free world?

It's actually a pretty pleasant combination.  (This review is for the cappuccino flavor.)This is relatively thick although it still flows freely (it's definitely a shake, not a smoothie).  It's vegan (contains soy milk) and has some thickeners like xanthan gum.  It contains four sweeteners (rice syrup solids, cane syrup, inulin, and stevia) but the sugar level is actually fairly low, considering that (6g of sugars which are going to be almost exclusively from the rice syrup solids and the cane syrup).  I don't normally drink sugary things, and I don't often like sugary drinks, but I thought it worked here.  The sugar mix is low glycemic, too, and the whole product is organic and gluten-free.This is very high in protein and in fiber and is supplemented with vitamins and minerals, including some like B12 and zinc that can be hard to get in a vegan or vegetarian diet.  At 180 calories, with all that protein and fiber, this would probably make a decent on-the-go breakfast, maybe with a piece of fruit.I drank this at the end of a long day where I was completely exhausted from not enough sleep and lots of physical activity.

They find it easier to put a token amount of splenda so they can put it on the label and you will think better of the product. I only would buy this if there was no alternative available and it was necessary due to blood sugar level control otherwise pass on it. I hate food companies that lie. Even small lies. It is like a famous brand of shortening on the market that says 0 grams of trans fats on the label but in reality it is 100 percent hydrogenated oil which is trans fat. Even though the entire can is only trans fat they made the serving size so small that it contains less than 1 gram of trans fat so they can put contains 0 grams trans fat on the label to cheat their customers by deception.  Torani sugar free syrup would not sell much if they put sweetened with acsulfame potassium on the front of the bottle instead of splenda. Nuff said.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2011", "summary": "Not very sweet, splenda is minor ingredient"}

I hate sodium benzoate, a nasty preservative that has a disturbing habit of changing structure and turning into benzene, a trigger for bone cell leukemia. Plus it tastes gross. What is that garbage doing in our drinks? But I digress. \"Aloe Gloe\" doesn't have it, and it also doesn't have citric acid, which besides tasting bad helps sodium benzoate do its little cancer quick change (they are frequently together). Instead we have malic acid, usually derived from apples. Perhaps it's the malic acid that gives \"Aloe Gloe\" a discernible apple-like flavor. Or it could be the \"natural flavors\" listed on the label.This aloe drink tastes pretty decent (a sliding scale to be sure), kind of like a Pink Lady apple. The product is made with aloe powder and not pure aloe juice, and is diluted with water. There is both cane sugar and stevia, and I think it would have been better to drop the stevia as it has a bit of that yick stevia aftertaste. The sweetener combination is a case of trying to please everyone while probably pleasing no one: Those avoiding sugar won't like the sugar content (though it's only 4 grams per serving) and those who hate stevia (or like my sister have an allergy) won't like the distinctive stevia taste. Why put them in there at all? Does everything need to be super sweet?  But again, I digress.So to sum up: Aloe powder instead of pure juice, 4 grams of sugar per serving but also with a fairly strong taste of stevia, semi-pleasant tasting, probably not terribly medicinal. If you need the real deal, then better to get the real deal (I like Lakewood Organics Aloe). But if you like stevia and the flavor of apples, you might want to give it a try.GRADE: B/B-", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2013", "summary": "For That Preservative-Free Glow"}

All they had in stock was this version, so I decided to give it a try. I personally like the flavor. It tastes like cream soda to me, and it is neither too sweet nor too tart, with a nice level of carbonation.The only kind of soda I've consumed for decades is diet, so the diet taste doesn't bother me, and it has no aftertaste. However, since artificial sweeteners pose health concerns, I would not feel comfortable drinking or eating anything containing them on a daily basis. Likewise for artificial and natural flavors. When I really need an energy boost, however, the Rockstar products seem to work much better than coffee, providing a boost without the jitters coffee gives me.This can has 16 ounces. The recommended serving size printed on the can is 8 ounces, which has 10 calories. I personally only need 4 ounces to get a good energy boost, even when feeling extremely sleepy in a mid-afternoon slump. I refrigerate the leftover energy drink in a SodaStream Penguin glass carafe to preserve the carbonation because I have several on hand that I use for my Sodastream Penguin soda maker.Here is the ingredient list on the can: Carbonated water, citric acid, taurine, natural and artificial flavors, sodium citrate, caffeine, caramel color, benzoic acid, sorbic acid, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, l-carnitine, inositol, niacinamide, calcium panthothenate, milk thistle extract, ginkgo biloba leaf extract, guarana seed extract, panax ginseng root extract, riboflavin, pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin.I was favorably impressed with many of the ingredients of this drink, with several exceptions (see above and below). I understand that Rockstar's original flavors of energy drink are extremely high in calories, about 240 or so for a 16-ounce can this size, and many people do not want to drink that many calories.I researched all of the ingredients, many of which might not be immediately recognizable to most consumers--those that are obvious (such as carbonated water), I have not listed below:Citric acid - This is a natural acid found in many fruits which is a safe preservative.Taurine - This is an amino acid popular with athletes. Research indicates it is a potent antioxidant supportive of nerve, brain, and heart function and cardiovascular health in general. It has also been used to treat diabetes, retinal damage and diabetes.Natural flavor - The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: \"The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional\" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.Artificial flavor - The definition of artificial flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: \"Any substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof. \" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab. Even more so than for a \"natural\" flavor, because the process by which it is derived is unexplained, there is no way for the consumer to decide how safe the artificial flavor is.Benzoic Acid - This is a widely used food preservative created from a chemical process involving toluene, a benzene derivative. Benzene is a highly toxic chemical, so this particular ingredient is dubious at best, and there is no need for it because the product contains multiple other preservatives. A major concern for benzoic acid in soft drinks is when ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is also present as a preservative, which combines with benzoic acid and causes it to revert to benzene. Fortunately there is no ascorbic acid in this drink or it would be too dangerous to consume.Sorbic Acid - This is an antimicrobial agent frequently used in food and drink to prevent the growth of mold, yeast, and fungi, which not only taste bad, but are toxic.Acesulfame potassium and sucralose - These are artificial sweeteners, whose safety is debated.l-Carnitine - This is an amino acid which functions in the body as an antioxidant. It has been found to normalize glucose in the blood and is beneficial to heart health.Inositol - This is a B vitamin produced naturally in the body. It participates in the action of serotonin an, as such, may naturally elevate the mood.Niacinamide - This is the technical term for vitamin B3. It helps the body maintain blood sugar levels and improve the strength and recovery from fatigue of muscles. It is also prescribed by doctors to decrease blood lipid levels and relieve joint pain.Calcium Panthothenate - This is the technical term for vitamin B-5. This vitamin, especially when taken in conjunction with the complete complex of B vitamins, can increase energy levels, improve brain health, promote the healing of wounds, increase immune function, regulate the production of hormones, and improve the mood.Milk thistle extract - This is an herb known to detoxify the liver and improve its function.Ginkgo biloba leaf extract - There have been decades of research on this powerful, healing herb. Its beneficial actions include: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, healing of the cardiovascular system and neuropathy, and a stimulating effect on neurotransmitters. It is known to improve mental functioning, particularly the memory.Guarana Seed Extractive - This is a natural stimulant high in caffeine produced from the berries of an Amazonian shrub.Panax ginseng root extract - This plant substance improves concentration, memory, and physical stamina. It is known as an \"adaptogen\" because it improves general well-being and health. It is a mood elevator without the dangerous side effects of of anxiety and depression drugs. It has been used to treat chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia, to boost the immune system, and to treat lung infections associated with cystic fibrosis. It fights cancer, anemia, diabetes, asthma, fever, nerve pain, joint pain, dizziness, headaches, hot flashes due to menopause, and hangover.Riboflavin - Riboflavin (vitamin B2) aids in red blood cell production and assists the body to release energy from carbohydrates. The body does not make this vitamin. It must be consumed. It is readily available in dairy, meat, legumes, nuts, eggs and green leafy vegetables.Pyridoxine hydrochloride - This is vitamin B6. The main benefits it provides that are useful in an energy drink are increasing cognitive function and reducing muscle cramps. It has a huge list of other benefits as well. It is known to boost immune function and be helpful in the treatment of anemia, heart disease, high cholesterol, PMS, nausea from pregnancy, post-partum deprepression, \"hot flashes\" of menopause, ADD, Alzheimer's, Down syndrome, autism, diabetes, migraine headaches, asthma, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, allergies, skin conditions, infertility, infections of all kinds, prevention of cancer, and overcoming the side effects of radiation and dangerous prescription drugs (though in much higher doses than in this drink, and with a doctor's supervision).Cyanocobalamin - This is vitamin B12. It is vital for the body to convert carbohydrates into glucose, which leads to energy production, which prevents fatigue. It helps keep the nervous system healthy. It reduces depression, stress and brain shrinkage. It promotes a healthy digestive system. It protects against heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure. It is essential for healthy skin, hair and nails. It helps prevent cancer.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2013", "summary": "Tastes like old-fashioned cream soda"}
