The appliance can actually sense the cooking of the rice.  It knows when the moisture level is just right and will adjust if you add a little too much water etc.  It then automatically goes to a \"keep warm\" mode, until you are ready to serve.This cooker has several advantages that make it a more useful product.  Being able to steam a vegetable at the same time the rice is cooking is a terrific feature that we often use----The summer is hot here in Arizona and we like to limit use of the stove when the air conditioner is running.  The veggies along with the rice come out to a T!  Thought we would try a cake.  The instruction book recipe seemed weird and wrong!  We threw all caution to the wind and used a box of regular 18.25 oz. Duncan Hines Devils Food cake mix, following the instructions for ingredients.....it came out perfect.  I will say it was not quite done when the cycle was over, but keeping the cake in the cooker an extra 5 minutes after it went to the keep warm mode did the trick. The cake was as high as a two layer cake (approx.3-4\")and was beautifully moist.  We now have cake without firing off the oven----perfect!We purchased the \"Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook\" by Beth Hensperger from Amazon which contains many recipes for soup, puddings, polenta and more which are fairly easy to  prepare using the rice cooker instead of the stove.  I will have to say that yes the rice comes out perfect, this cooker does so much more, including slow cooking, veggies---well, it just makes food prep easier and more enjoyable.  So from here in the land where it can reach 115 in the summer I can truly recommend this product.If you do purchase this be bold, very bold and bake a cake, do a stew, steam veggies, make a pudding, let it make your life just a little easier.  I think you will be impressed with your purchase, as I am, and will use it a lot.....", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009", "summary": "Not Just For Rice!---it's so much more."}

I figured for the price, I'd give it a shot.I have only used it one time so far, so I am not sure how long the blades will last as far as the sharpness, but I definitely will come back and update if and when they go dull and no longer work.This device DOES work and does make perfect french fries. You must cut and place the potato properly, in order for it to NOT get jammed in there. The reviews which state that the potato jammed, was stuck, couldn't cut etc is because the potato was not straight in the device.You have to cut off an end of the potato - making the end flat. Do not cut it slanted, you need it as flat and straight as possible. If it is slanted, that is when it jams and gets stuck - it's because the potato is being pushed in at a slant then and yes it will get stuck on the blades and you will have to use the tool to pop it out.If you cut a nice flat end off, you will have no problem with a potato getting stuck at all. You place the flat end against the blades and then place the top piece on.You have to push (slam) the top part down onto the bottom part which contains the blade grid. You kinda have to put a little &#34;oomph&#34; in it. I am pretty sure I threw out my shoulder and I still have a sore neck, but the fries were soooo good. The good news is that you will be surprised how few potatos you actually need for a huge heap of fries. A typical size potato makes a nice serving size of fries. So, you only need to take a few whacks at this thing to feed your family.Overall I am actually quite happy with this handy dandy little device. For four bucks, it is a deal.

The product really has to be quite special for that... and this mattress fit the bill.  My husband and I were on the lookout for a new mattress for over 6 months.  We were sick and tired of our mattresses basically failing within 5 years.. even with the 10 year warranties which ended up not covering anything that actually broke.  I wanted something more like a sleep number bed, but my husband was really leaning toward a foam bed.  I had heard that foam beds were uncomfortable and hot.  Most of my friends who had gotten foam beds in the past, had returned them within 3 months.  So admittedly, I went into buying this bed with a bit of a bad attitude.What I like about this bed.  It is really quite comfortable!  I am one for a firmer type of mattress. Granted, I don't want to sleep on a board, it should have some give, but I don't want to sink down into it.  This mattress was perfect.  It conforms to your body, but you definitely don't 'sink'.  It was much more firm than I thought it would be.  I will say, I used to wake up a bit stiff and since getting this bed, I don't anymore.Another thing that is great about this mattress is that you do NOT get hot in it.  Again, one of the main complaints I had heard over and over about other foam mattresses was how hot they were.  Not so with this one.  My husband gets very hot at night and he has not had any issue with this bed being hotter than any other mattress we've owned.Some other things I was very happy with was... We used our regular box springs underneath and that hasn't effected the quality of this bed either.  It is a true to size king sized mattress.  I liked that all our sheets were able to fit over the mattress (i.e. the thickness of the mattress although quite thick wasn't so thick that I had to go out and buy new extra-depth type sheets). Then there was the price!  We did a lot of comparison shopping and the price compared to other foam mattresses (along with traditional type mattresses) really couldn't be beat!  Lastly, I loved how this was delivered and how easy it was to just put on the bed.  I thought it was a bit heavy, but my husband says it's no heavier than any other mattress.  I also liked that we got two pillows out of the same foam as well (a nice little bonus).One thing that really bothered me when we first got this mattress was the smell.  Now, the manufacturer does say to 'air it out' for a number of days and the smell should disappear.  Frankly, I smelled the odor for quite a long time and was worried that it wouldn't go away.  My husband smelled it too, but after about a week he said he couldn't smell it anymore.  I, however, smelled it for a good month afterward.  Granted it eventually totally faded away, but was still there for a lot longer than I anticipated.Overall, this was an A+ purchase and one we have not regretted in the least.  It's very comfortable, not hot, and was priced right!  I will note here again, this mattress is more FIRM than I think most people would imagine a foam mattress to be.  It does 'break in' a little over time, but it's still firm.  Also, the odor will eventually go away, but it takes a little longer than the manufacturer says (at least that's been our experiences).We have had this mattress now for about 9 months and have really been happy with it.  We actually ended up getting a twin sized version of this mattress for one of our children (whose mattress had pretty much died).  She, too, has been really happy with it.  If we need another mattress in the future, this will be our 'go to' choice.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2014", "summary": "DynastyMattress Cool Breeze (King and Twin)"}

I think it's a fantastic machine. I remember reading reviewer's complaints about the clean-up, and I thought they were just being picky. Once we started juicing several times a day, though, cleaning up the Breville became really annoying. You can't just rinse out the parts - you have to scrub out the pulp. Dishwashing won't get it out, you have to do it by hand.Anyway, we decided to try the Nutribullet. So far I love it. It blends things very smoothly and clean-up is just a good rinse. Here's the thing, however: if you were juicing you cannot use your recipes the same way with the Nutribullet. For instance, one of my favorite juices was ginger-carrot-apple. In a juicer it comes out nice and smooth. But with the Nutribullet you are getting the apple fiber, so you are essentially making apple sauce, not juice. But, on the other hand, you will be using less fruits and vegetables overall and getting more out of it, saving you money. AND - the biggest thing for me - you will actually feel FULL after a Nutribullet &#34;blast&#34; versus a juicer &#34;Juice&#34; because of all the fiber. So you will also be saving on calories.My advice to former juicers would be to use the recipes in the book that comes with it first, instead of your own juicing recipes, because you may get a bad first impression. Your juicing recipes will definitely have to be adjusted. You will need to reduce the amount of spinach or kale you were using because since you are now getting the full amount of the vegetable, it will be too bitter. I'm still working on apple mixes because of the thickness. But it's so much more convenient than a juicer, and you use so much less produce.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2014", "summary": "Easier than Juicing"}

This replaces a dual chamber that I got for a gift several years ago.First, I will say that it picks up nearly EVERYTHING on the first pass. It does sometimes take an additional pass or two to pick up bird feathers. We have a short-haired dog, and I am always amazed at how much hair it picks up! We have been using it for about a week now.For the most part, it is simple to use. The button for releasing the canister took some getting used to (it wasn't intuitive) and the latch for keeping the canister closed is not the best quality. I am worried that it might not last as long as the vacuum will work.I have a few very minor issues, though:1. The cord is not long enough. I don't know why manufacturers have decided to shorten cords in the past few years, but on our carpet cleaner and now vacuum, the cords no longer reach the entire length of our great room, whereas they did on older models. So I either have to plug in to our TV power strip or unplug and replug on the opposite end of the room during vacuuming.2. The \"power\" brush attachment leaves much to be desired. The one on our old Hoover did a much better job (there was a \"Power burst\" setting for it on the old machine). It takes twice as long to get the dog hair off of our couches now. You can't push down at all while using it or the brush stops rotating.3. The hose is the kind that self compresses, it does NOT like to stay stretched open. While it makes it convenient to put away, it gets irritating when you are trying to clean something and you are always yanking at the hose to expand.4. This is very minor, but since the cord is self retracting, there is no hook for it up by the handle, so you have to reach down and grab it if you want to keep the cord out of the way while vacuuming.All-in-all, this is a great vacuum that I would recommend, especially to pet owners.

On may back, I didn't have enough support, and on my side, my hip was not supported and caused too much pain to remain on my side.The final part of the solution was a cheap, thin, back pillow typically used for a car seat (bought on Amazon for 15 bucks). While on my back, with it just below my lower back, I feel a bit uncomfortable (it's probably slightly too thick). On my side it's perfect. End result is a good nights sleep and a back that has felt better than it has for over a year.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2013", "summary": "This was one part of the solution"}

There is NO REQUIRED TAG telling what the filling consists of (\"Do Not Remove Under Penalty of Law.)\" The shredded foam inside could come from previously-used memory foam mattresses for all we know.Aside from that, the pillow cover itself has a sewn in layer of some kind of squishy stuff (is this the \"gel\"?) about 1/8 inch thick, which makes the cover quite firm and creates the \"dent\" of memory foam.  When the cover is removed, however, you have a whole bunch of shredded foam, a real lot of it, in a flimsy stretchy sewn case, and some of the foam shreds are even quite hard to the touch, which makes me wonder about its source.The pillow as sold is way too thick and firm to be comfortable.

Wash them flat in the dishwasher, on the top rack.As for the dehydrator:  what can I say of such things? This was my first, and I've been wanting one for about twenty years. It's great as a way to make jerky (my favorite use), but you can dehydrate basically any organic matter in it. Of course, you probably don't want to dry chicken or pork in it! But I've really enjoyed mine.I can't speak to long-term durability or anything like that, but for my purposes as an amateur food dryer guy, this dehydrator works great. It's a great starter unit, I think. Even if I end up getting a new one that's bigger and fancier, I think I'll hang onto this one for small and experimental projects.Do make sure you read up about using your dehydrator, though -- there are a lot of things to know about drying foods. For example, trim as much fat off your beef as you can before you dry it. Sometimes, apples dry better with a little dusting of sugar and cinnamon on them. That kind of thing.

The manufacturer says the plates are designed to produce \"heart\" shaped waffles, but I'd describe the shape more like a pie wedge. Still, a nice change from the traditional square or rectangular shape.There are several pluses to this model. The non-stick coating works well, and releases the waffles easily. Heat-up time is decent, and it has an indicator light that shows when the temperature is correct for usage. The \"stay cool\" handle is a nice design feature and does help keep your hand from hitting the hot surface. It has a browning level dial at the top.On the downside, the plates are not removable, which makes clean-up a bit more difficult. The fixed plates also mean it can't be used for anything other than waffles. The handle, while it does stay cool, would benefit from extending further from the housing so you could get a better grip (especially if you have large hands). The browning level is not very accurate - there's a large \"dead spot\" in the middle of the dial range that seems to have little effect on the waffle doneness.The cooking was generally even. It clearly has some hot spots near the center that produce a bit of a mottled level of doneness, but nothing that was what I would describe as significantly uneven.Tip: clean the plates well before using it for the first time. I didn't, and the plates got rather smelly (sort of a plasticy scent) when they heated up. I unplugged it, let it cool, and gave the plates a good cleaning. The second time they heated without any smell.While it does not excel in terms of build quality, features or performance, it gets the job done. It's worth considering if you're looking for an occasional waffle and don't want to spend a lot on a more advanced, but more capable, waffle maker.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2013", "summary": "A generally average waffle maker"}

The Brushroll Clean technology sounds like a great idea.  However, the Brushroll on my vacuum failed out of the box so I was unable to try the Brushroll Clean feature.  I tried the troubleshooting suggestions in the manual without success.  I called the telephone help line but was disconnected on two occasions so I gave up on trying to have it repaired under warranty.Without the working Brushroll the Electrolux is not able to effectively clean my carpets.  I'll stick to my Hoovers and Bissells.****UPDATE 02/10/2013****The above was written prior to replacement under warranty.  Electrolux Care noticed my disappointed review and expedited my contact with customer service.  I mailed in the serial number sticker and reference number and roughly two weeks later received a replacement vacuum cleaner.  So kudos to Electrolux for their warranty service; I'm glad they take note of customer complaints on Amazon seriously.  The 5 year manufacturer's warranty certainly adds peace of mind.With the replacement vacuum cleaner, the Brushroll IS fortunately working.  The Electrolux seems better suited to apartment dwellers, with it's smaller canister size and overall footprint.PROS:- Super easy (100% tool-less) assembly; didn't have any misfitting pieces like in several Bissells I tested previously.- Handle easily detaches to form telescoping cleaning wand- Neat Brushroll Cleaning feature; really does work!- Easy to empty canister- Small footprint- Blue LED indicator lights on the front indicate selected settings- \"futuristic\" sleek colors and look- Washable HEPA filterCONS:- The vacuum cleaner is heavy- surprising, given its compact dimensions.  Better hit the gym, yo!- The Versa-tool sounds good in principle, but doesn't work all that well in practice- The suction seemed inconsistent; while it picked up lots of tiny dust particles, it left some macro particles stuck to my rug.In conclusion, I think the Electrolux has some great features (ease of assembly, Brushroll Cleaning, warranty service, blue LED indicator lights, small footprint, telescoping wand enablement), but the relatively higher price offsets these advantages.  I would still purchase the Hoover UH70600 first since it's $90 cheaper and has better suction power, but the Electrolux would be a close second.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 13, 2013", "summary": "I had high hopes for the Electrolux- (REVIEW UPDATED AFTER WARRANTY REPLACEMENT)"}

Because of its cylindrical shape, it's very easy to clean, especially because it is meant to hold hot fat, and anyone who's ever washed the dishes after roasting a fatty hunk of meat knows how difficult things get when a layer of grease is coating the item. I was worried that the handle part would be difficult to clean because that's where the mechanism is, but clean up is a breeze. It's dishwasher safe, too!I didn't like that the OXO brand version required the small plug, which could easily get lost or damaged, so that was eliminated first. The Trudeau brand version has a better sieve lid, but the oval shape seemed conducive to accidental tipping, especially when pouring from a heavy dutch oven.Some tips I've learned along the way are that it's very tough to stop the fat line on a dime, so leaving a half inch of liquid in the separator is preferable to even a little bit of fat getting back into the pot. Also, the longer you leave the fatty liquid in the separator before extracting, the more fat gets trapped. It seems obvious, but when you first pour the fatty liquid in, it's exciting to see the fat line so clearly, so you're tempted to extract right away. Even five minutes makes a big difference!I used to refrigerate the liquid overnight and then discard the fat cap, but cooking a day in advance of intended meal time isn't always practical. Then I went to cutting a small hole in zip top bags, but I didn't feel safe pouring burning hot liquid into that type of plastic.

Six quarts is just about the perfect size since I rarely cook for a crowd anymore.This is a nice, solid, reliable cooker. Presto does a good job on the owners manual, some basic recipes, etc. The cooker has a little rack so you can keep your meat off the floor of the cooker.This is not a canner. You could (and I have) use it as a little baby canner for a small load of small jars. I have used it as a canner for about 4-5 pints. The instructions do not say this is a canner, and you probably should know what you're doing if you plan to can with this. It takes about the same amount of time whether you can in this or in the giant cooker, so why not do a large load, I say.Pressure cooking doesn't necessarily save time depending on what you're cooking, when you consider it takes a while to build the pressure. This takes some practice, and knowing your food and your stove. I like it because it cooks meat really tender quicker than any other method.It takes very little experience to get to know the proper pressure without a guage.

This saved a lot of money, so I went to all space heaters and have bought many types.  One thing I've found is that no matter what type of radiant heater I've purchased, it doesn't heat the room as quickly or as well as even a small inexpensive fan unit.  Thankfully, this unit has fans, and the noise level is the typical low hum.  Also, I've started using programmable thermostat timers to give the functionality of a central heating thermostat.  To have these work, the unit needs to turn back on after a power disconnect.  This Ambia heater does that too.  However, these two things are also true of some less expensive heaters.The unique aspect of this heater is the ability to heat in two (up to 6' apart) locations, which is very handy for more evenly distributing the heat in a room.  Drafty rooms are managed better, with less of a \"heat pocket\" only around the heater.  It is also good for directing at one person from multiple locations to avoid one side feeling cold, or allowing two people to have their own.  In the latter case, those two people need to be close together.  It may be more practical to buy two space heaters and set each to low power. Speaking of settings, this unit allows either side to be on individually, or both to be on simultaneously.  There is no low power setting which allows both sides to output heat.  I think this is a fine compromise to avoid too many controls.  Although it looks like both sides detach, only one does.  That side can also be kept on the base at a different angle, which is nice, but the way it attaches is a bit flimsy and unintuitive.  The aesthetic of the unit could use some work, and the bland grey color doesn't help, but the look is not offensive.Overall, this is a good heater with a clever twist.  In terms of heat output, it does well, as any ceramic heater with this power usage should.

You pay a bit more for this than its more generic counterpart, but it's definitely better-constructed, not as likely to crack when tightened, seems to be all metal with black plastic (rather than silver plastic w/black plastic, as many are).  It's a compression aerator but doesn't make the high squealing noise, which my daughter finds very annoying, that similar cheaper ones do.Short of an actual separate hose sprayer, this is the best sink option I've seen.On the other hand, our fridge is black but I don't know if the lack of a white version would annoy those who are fully-color-coordinated.============It's almost 3 years later, and I've moved twice since writing the above review.  My current residence again does not offer a separate sink sprayer in the kitchen, so I went looking for another double-swivel aerator, and ordered this one for its primarily-metal construction, price, and design.  When I went to review the product, I found my own review from 2009, which I'd completely forgotten about;  I hadn't actually set out to buy the exact same product, and I didn't remember which I had bought before.Now, in 2012, I had already tried buying two different double-swivel aerators from local stores, and been disappointed in both.  Both seem to decrease my already borderline water pressure in this 100-year-old house, and neither could reach the far corners of the fairly large porcelain double sink.This aerator again reaches areas that others can't reach, through the combination of its length and double-swivel design.  The packaging notes that it has an \"improved design\", and I will say that it shifts from normal to spray with very little effort (something that is never true of the plastic aerators.)  And it does quite significantly increase the strength of the water flow coming from the faucet, rather than cutting the flow as most of the other aerators do.As other reviewers have noted, what are pluses for me may be detractions in different circumstances.  If you have a shallow sink and/or a faucet whose end is too close to the sink itself, the length of this aerator  will make it difficult to fit a pot or other large object underneath without working around the protrusion.  And if your water pressure is already great, you may find that the increased pressure causes water to splash all over when you just turn on the faucet normally.  (It even splashes a bit here at times, when I forget that I don't have to turn on the faucet full-force to get adequate water flow & strength.)I do like the increased spray strength because I don't have to wait as long to fill my coffee carafe, and I can use the strength of the spray to do a good job rinsing clean dishes or silverware, much as a dishwasher's water flow batters the gunk off dishes.Other reviewers note that the aerator may fail in various ways after a year or three of use.  The manufacturer has included instructions for sustaining the life of the product, but this being the real world where everything eventually breaks down, it's not really going to last forever.  However, the manufacturer does provide a \"lifetime guarantee\", and it seems they will accept it back for exchange if it fails at any point with normal use, although they do require $3 to cover return shipping;  I think I'd just get a new one if this failed after a few years.  And that guarantee is still far better than plastic aerators, whose parts eventually crack because plastic can't stand up to the daily use, pressure, and tightening needed to make them functional.It still seems a bit odd to me that I'd rave so much about such a small, inexpensive item ... but this is one product that quite literally makes life easier for me on a daily basis.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 20, 2009", "summary": "A bit pricey, but worth it"}

First off, the way it's marketed led me to believe that it was a two-tray system. Well, it is...kinda. You can only grow one tray at a time and the second tray merely sits atop the first to hold in humidity. Interesting wording.Secondly, it's basically a bucket with pump mounted underneath; another bucket that sits on top of that grows your sprouts. The real handicap this system has is that to drain and refill the water bucket, one has to basically disassemble and reassemble the unit to accomplish this. The operation involves pulling the top bucket off while trying not to pull the bottom water-riser tube off with it, and then trying to realign the riser tubes while putting the bucket back on top of the base. Can be pretty tricky. It doesn't take much to imagine parts soon loosening up or breaking from the daily necessity of assembling/disassembling the unit.I've boxed mine up to return and will reinvest in a better system. In its favor I'll say that at least the pump motor is quiet. But overall it's a very poorly thought-out system and certainly not worth the money.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2011", "summary": "Misrepresented and Cheaply Made"}

Still no rust either.I have bought a new cappuccino maker that makes a larger shot.  As a result I now need to froth more milk than when I bought this pitcher, so it's now just a bit too small.

Martin", "helpful": [1, 1], "unixReviewTime": 1385942400, "reviewText": "A trip to Italy earlier this year made me realize that the coffee we're accustomed to drinking here in the States is absolutely terrible.  So after getting a full-time telecommuting job, I began researching different coffee makers on the market in hopes to make something as close as what I had overseas.  Taking in the rave reviews for many coffee makers out there (including the renowned Bialetti Moka Pot and Chemex pour-over), I ended up going with the AeroPress, and I'm glad I did.The AeroPress is unlike most coffee makers on the market, and probably more akin to the the Clover machine at Starbucks in how it extracts coffee.  There are plenty of videos on YouTube on how to use the AeroPress, so I won't explain how it works.While the AeroPress is marketed as an espresso maker, it doesn't exactly make an espresso that you may be used to getting in your corner coffee shop.  It makes a very strong and rich coffee, which you can add water or milk to to create different coffee drinks.  I've never gotten a nice creama on any of the drinks out of my AeroPress--you'll need a nice espresso maker for that.While I use the AeroPress every morning, I still keep my Keurig around for when guests are over and multiple people want to make coffee.  The one downside to the AeroPress is the time it takes to brew your coffee.  It's a good 2-3 minute manual task, where the Keurig takes almost no time or effort.  But I use my AeroPress nearly twice a day, and never once cared about how long it took to make a cup.For AeroPress newbies, here are a few tips:- If you have crappy coffee, don't bother: The AeroPress won't magically make your pre-packaged, grocery store coffee taste any better.  Buy good, fresh, whole bean coffee and grind it yourself.  Many places on the internet will roast coffee at time of order and ship it to your house.- Get a nice grinder: Burr grinders are the best and offer the best consistency, but you can get by with a blade grinder.- Stop when you hear the \"hiss\": In starting out with the AeroPress, you may be tempted to push the plunger all the way down to get every little bit of flavor out of your coffee.  Don't do this.  Plunging all the way down will simply give your coffee a bitter flavor.  To avoid this, stop plunging as soon as you hear the hissing sound.- Try to \"invert\" it: Follow the instructions in the AeroPress manual.  After doing so, try making coffee using the \"inversion\" method.  Google will tell you how to do this.  I prefer this method over the standard \"AeroPress\" way, but try it out and see what works for you.- Experiment, experiment, experiment!: The great thing about the AeroPress is that it gives you full control over your coffee.  Every nuance of the coffee making process, from how much coffee and water you use to the precise temperature and steep time you use, is up to you!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2013", "summary": "Great Coffee Maker--Just Make Sure to use Quality Coffee!"}

Sometimes it works great, others it is just stops (and, it's not because of the batteries).  I end up having to flip it over a few times and shake it to get it to work again.I have had this for about 6 months.

I read lots of negative reviews but decided to get anyway. I am glad I did!First I want to say that you really have to watch it when assembling. The instructions aren't that great, mostly photos, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure assembly out.  I put one of the racks on upside down and after puttng it together, had to take it apart and re-do. I was excited to get it so wasn't paying attention. It only takes a few minutes to do so that was no problem. You do NOT need any tools to put together or take apart. &lt;A MALLET - REALLY??> A shove with the butt of your hand will get the shelves out from the plastic shelf grippers. I bought 2 of these as I have a very large cabinet and it took me 20 minutes to put both together, including taking the first apart and back together again.If you don't get those shelf grippers on correctly, the shelf will wobble. I was worried I wasn't doing it right because they don't close all the way - but they are just fine with the shelves on.Be sure to read the item description for size - lot of complaints that this is small. It does say CABINET Organzer so not sure how big you'd want it - most cabinets are around the size of this shelf. I was able to put over 70 cans on one rack - about 20-25 on each shelf - tomato paste, picante/hot sauce, green beans, peas, carrots, condensed milk, etc. The bottom rack alone has 6 large cans that weigh 1 pound 12 ounces each &lt; 16 pounds approx. there> and 6 regular size cans &lt;14.75 ounces - 1.6 pounds each> for a total of about 23 pounds on the bottom shelf. I put boxed food on the other shelf, although I might switch for more canned food items.Not sure what everyone is talking about regarding rusting? My shelves are in a cabinet next to my stove and have been there for over 2  months and I haven't had to clean them and they look just as brand new as the day I bought them. I would suggest using a dry rag to \"dust off\" if you feel the need? Since my shelves are holding canned food - there is no wetness. They are in my kitchen and we cook all the time and the sink is in the same room, and my laundry is in the very next room - but none of that has affected my shelves. And I live in Texas where the humidity is ridiculously high!I like that I am able to see all the items on my shelf without having to dig around the cabinet. We did have to remove a shelf in order for it to fit as it was higher then I expected, but that is no big deal - I can put the shelf back in if I decide to move the rack. I also like that you can adjust the height of the racks to whatever you want - they don't have to be as the photo shows. AND I like that the shelves store easily as they come apart easy. Remember to keep the little plastic feet that they shipped with so the racks aren't touching and won't scracth the metal in storage.The construction of these organizers is well made, strong and I can see them ladting for many years. I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this product!I posted a photo of my rack, it's the last photo showng canned foods.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013", "summary": "AWESOME Racking!

Howes", "helpful": [2, 2], "unixReviewTime": 1296432000, "reviewText": "There are a many collections of stainless cookware sold these days as people flee from Teflon based non-sticks. If you go to Wal*Mart, they will be happy to sell you an extremely cheaply made stainless set for less than  a third of this set. Don't  do it. The ultra cheap ones have shoddy rivets which will leak and give way over time, and do not have the thick disk of heat conducting aluminum which will prevent hot spots from scorching your food. Nor do they have the beautiful heat delaying silicon rubber handles of this set, or the silicon rubber gaskets around the lids. Cookware should last a lifetime, and should be bought with an eye towards long term value.Let me walk you through a simple recipe, and how well the qualities of these pots made my life easier. Shepherd's Pie calls for mashed potatoes, sauteing meat and vegetables, finishing with time in the oven. I choose the 3Qt sauce pan for the potatoes, and the 3Qt sauteing pan for everything else. The sauce pan is tall and of ample capacity to boil 3 large quartered potatoes, its big aluminum disk delivered the heat to the water efficiently and without big bumps from hot spots. And the gasketed lid stayed on quietly. After cooking, I drained the pot, and just used a big wooden spoon to mash the potatoes inside the pot. The pot is tall for its size, and this seems to make it easier to mash without mess. The sauteing pan was big enough to brown a full pound of lamb without having to resort to batches, and then to accept a large chopped onion, carrots and mushrooms without overflowing. Everything cooked uniformly, even while doing a reduction. Then beef stock for a quick deglaze and a simmer under the pan's beautiful lid. There was plenty of room to put the mashed potatoes on top. And finally, the whole pan could be put in the oven to melt and brown a topping of cheese.  Afterwards, everything cleaned up easily as there were no hotspot traps for scorched food.I had not known what I was missing in terms of having to work around my old pans.Not that these pans are for everyone. They are not non-stick. If you don't deglaze frequently in your cuisine, or aren't sure what deglazing is, then maybe you would prefer something non-stick like anodized aluminum, or enameled iron, or even an old fashioned iron skillet. I have an anodized omelet pan and there is no way I would use any of the pans in this collection to cook an omelet. Life is just too short.The handles are nice, but don't expect them to eliminate the need for oven mitts. Yes, you can handle the stock pots and saute pans on the stove top with comfort, usually, but you can't expect a stock pot filled with bubbling water not to have hot handles, much less any pot coming out of an oven. They are lovely though, and comfortable grasping the silicon grips when cool to warm.The lids are great because of their gaskets, keeping a nice quiet connection with the pot, but I don't know that there is much benefit to their being see through, at least when dealing with anything with water in it. The lids very rapidly form a translucent layer of micro drops making it pretty much impossible to peer into the covered pot.  Again, they are certainly lovely though.Everything cleans nicely in the dishwasher, excepting the stock pot which is too large for my dishwasher.I'm very happy with this set, and think it well worth any additional cost above el-cheapo sets you might find at discount or warehouse stores--the display model for the stainless steel cookware set my local BJ's sells was already falling apart. If I were interested in getting a set for an inexperienced cook, I might look at jumping toKitchenAid's anodized cookwarewhich look sweet indeed, or at least acquiring a few additional anodized pieces. Still if you are serious about cooking, this is a good starting point.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2011", "summary": "Elegant yet Utilitarian Cookware Set"}

As others have pointed out, this set could be improved by having some larger bowls.  The Serveware line features larger bowls, made of textured glass, that look nicer on the table than these plain glass bowls.  But the Serveware bowls don't come with lids; you need to use disposable plastic wrap for refrigerator storage.The bowls in this set have mostly straight sides.  While this is more efficient for storing things in your refrigerator, it's less so for stacking the set in your cupboards when not in use.  A bit more taper in the sides would let the same-size bowls stack better.  The Serveware bowls have quite a lot of taper in the sides, so they stack together well in the cupboard but don't use space in the refrigerator efficiently.Here's what Pyrex needs to produce: a set of bowls, mostly larger than in this set, with the attractive texture of the Serveware line.  The sides should have a moderate amount of taper so they'll stack together in your cupboards.  They should have lids that fit the bowls.WATCH OUT for mismatched lids.  My set came with the correct assortment of bowls, but 5 small lids for the 4 small bowls and only 1 medium lid for the 2 medium bowls.  Of course I didn't check this until I'd already run the full set through the dishwasher and torn the box apart for curbside recycling.  I would have rated the set 4 stars without this warehouse goof.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2005", "summary": "A few changes could improve this line"}

I tried it followed by 6 passes through the polisher (3 on each side).

I picked it up to hold a set of new Yoshi ceramic knives that I had bought here on Amazon just a while back, and to handle some small santoku steel knives as well.  The block I had when I bought the knives had the usual variety of slots as all blocks do that frustratingly wouldn't hold all my knives.  Some of the knives were too fat and just stuck out.  The slots on the block needed to all be the wide variety.  Unfortunately all knife blocks insist on giving you this distributed style.  When I saw one of these Kapoosh blocks in a store, I knew it the answer to my problem.  The kapoosh is really nothing but a block of skinny flexible plastic rods tightly packed that just spread and hold onto any knife or other object that is stuck in them. Its sorta like a modern kitchen version of quicksand. The advantages over this material and system is that one can not only make any shape knife fit securely in the kapoosh, but you get the added benefit of fitting in twice as many knives in the same size area that a slotted block would handle. No longer will an odd size or number of knives be a problem.  The knife block is made of a nice heavy oak or maple like just about all blocks are, and its handsome looking as well.Personally I don't experience any of the slippage that some of the other reviewers here have mentioned.  That is, a heavy knife sliding down the through the rods over time.  On the other hand, my collection of knives are not made up of a heavy variety.  Bigger knives I have tried in the block do indeed slip down a little over time, but not so much that it becomes a real liability, or any kind of deal breaker over this fine block. Also, some other comments at the time of this writing asked about the dimensions of this block. (And frankly I am surprised that no one has fully stated it up till now).  I don't know where Amazon gets its dimensions from, for although this block is indeed about 10\" high, the other numbers are way off.  For the record, this block face, (the part that really matters the most but not mentioned) is 4 1/2 inches square.  Plenty of room and versatility over a 4 inch square slotted block to be sure.  Lastly the kapoosh material can be removed for washing whenever it really needs it, or one gets the notion.  Personally this knife block is number one in my book.  I love it, and I highly recommend it over the traditional variety...", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2010", "summary": "Soild, And The Best For Numerous Knives"}

I tend to be sensitive to tastes.They are cheap, functional and sturdy however the design itself doesn't seem all that conducive to eating eggs. I use these for soft boiled eggs. I assume that is what all people use egg spoons for (at least when it comes to eating eggs) I'm not sure when else you would need a spoon? If you are using these for another purpose this review may not be for you.My issue is that the width of the spoon means that you have to cut / crack off a larger top hole that normal. I grew up using more narrow spoons which allowed me to keep more of the shell on. This seems like a small issue however if you happen to have a runny yolk that is near the area you cracked the top off of as soon as you pierce the yolk it will run out of the egg shell and onto the egg cup.In order to get the wider hole in the egg you will have had to cut lower onto the egg itself and thus you have a greater risk of being at the level or below the yolk. This equals messy disaster of trying to scoop up all the yolk or delicately eating around the yolk enough so that this doesnt occur. I personally would prefer more narrow egg spoons. But to each their own.If you like your yolks runny perhaps try a different spoon?", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2014", "summary": "Basic spoons"}

We have two parrots in our house and they tend to have moments when their cages aren't the most attractive thing to be around if you have clear nasal passages (we clean them multiple times a week. This is just due to them doing their natural thing). Unfortunately, this unit ended up being really small, and while it did do a great job for its size it wasn't really built to handle a whole living room. So, this got moved to the roommate's room where he smokes cigarettes and it does an AWESOME job with that smell in a smaller space. After seeing how well this unit worked we ended up getting the Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier for the living room and it too works extremely well. I would recommend either of these products, but for a room that is larger than 10x10 I would recommend the Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier. Now, many people complain that they feel ripped off by the fact that this takes 3 filters to run. Yeah, it's kind of expensive.. but if you are going to purchase something that cleans the air you're going to need some form of filter, and these only need to be replaced every 3-4 months if you leave it on every minute of the day. I spend more than $16 every 3-4 months on so much useless junk that it seems a bit ridiculous to complain about that sum when it ends up averaging a roughly $5/month investment to keep your place smelling fresh. Realistically, that's less than a glad plugin will run you for a full month of utilization and the hamilton beach odor dealio actually filters the air and doesn't just cover up the smells.In the end, it's up to you. If you're looking for a solution to a smell issue that has to do with smoke, animals, etc. then this is a great solution for a small room - and the Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier is a great solution for a larger room. If you never want to have to replace any filters or anything like that then you are probably going to have to spend a bit more up front - I think the Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier does have some reusable filters, but they have to be purchased separately.I have been using this product for 4 months straight at its maximum output without ever turning it off and have not had a single problem.

I had the Cuinsinart ICE-50BC for about a year before the motor died.  The thickness of the ice cream apparently causes the motors that burn out.  The $250 ice creams makers appear to be a poor overall product.  Few have extended warranties, and probably for good reason.  The more expensive models in the $600 range probably have motors that can operate through thick ice cream without burning out.

But that is not a bad thing; the heavier fans I had always eventually collapsed on their stands, making them unsafe around children and pets. They also only lasted 2-3 years. Hopefully, this one will last longer.  Because, believe me, if you live in a a place with HOT summers, you miss these powerful metal floor fans when they die!Bottom line--if you need fans to survive the summer, and don't mind loud ones: Go with the biggest metal floor fan--with the biggest blades and most powerful motor--that you can afford!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2005", "summary": "A Powerful Fan for Hot, Humid Days!"}

It is stored neatly in my broom closet. The machine swivels but I guess the handle just couldn't take it anymore. I suppose I can still use it but this is extremely annoying. I can no longer wind the cord up since the top winder is no longer part of the column. Sheesh!Original review: (2011 11 06)I purchased this steam mop over a month ago. At first, I was using it everyday, but now use it twice or three times a week. My floors are combination ceramic tile and laminate flooring.Pros: fast and easy to set up, easy to fill, comes with 3 cleaning pads, heats quickly, light and easy to store, electric cord is quite long. It does a nice job cleaning the centre of the floor. Does a decent job on the ceramic tile.Cons: On my laminate, pushes fine dirt and hairs not sucked up by the vacuum cleaner, away from the pad, but does not pick it up, so half the time I have to wipe these lines up with a paper towel. As well, on the laminate, it sometimes streaks and makes the floor look dull. Because the floor is damp, you have to swipe walking away from the surface just cleaned. The machine is not easily swivelled to pick up what has just been pushed away, so it's a little awkward to clean the floor perfectly. In fact, except for long north to south strokes, the unit is not very maneuverable. Because of this, it does not do a great job around edges or near walls.Overall, I am happy with the purchase at $50, but would have had greater expectations had I paid more and not read the previous reviews.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "11 6, 2011", "summary": "Ooops!

As an owner of a different Panasonic vacuum cleaner (model # MC-UL815), I have to say this vacuum performed much more admirably than its higher priced predecessor. While the other model claimed to have superior flexibility, it was in fact extremely difficult to maneuver. This new vacuum from Panasonic gets back to basics and the result is a vacuum that is very easy to use. The vacuum is relatively light (4 pounds lighter than my last Panasonic vacuum to be exact) which makes a huge difference when lugging it up 10-15 steps. Also, it picks up great and isn't as loud as my other Panasonic vacuum. If I had one complaint to make regarding it, it would be that the size of the filter is on the small side and constantly needs to be cleaned, so if you have a pet, keep this in mind. Overall though, this is a great offering from Panasonic and a definite step in the right direction for their vacuum cleaner line.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2013", "summary": "Solid Vacuum From Panasonic"}

Because water gets pumped immediately through the machine upon pressing one of the buttons, the ease of this machine is lost unless the water reservoir is kept filled and ready to brew.For brewing, simply insert a pod/K-cup and select the serving size.  In less than a minute, you'll have a hot, forced water-brewed cup of coffee.  Tthe unit has three buttons that correspond to the desired size of the cup: small (demi-tasse), medium, and large.  Since the amount of coffee in each pod remains constant, the size also determines strength of the brew.  I prefer the middle size because the large is too weak for my tastes and the small produces too little coffee.  (If you are looking for espresso and cappuccino, tryNespresso D290 Concept Espresso and Coffeemakerfor similar ease of use and better coffee.)If you drink a lot of coffee, this coffee maker may not be for you since it can be expensive per cup.  If your household doesn't drink a lot, however, then it saves the waste of having to brew more cups than you want.  The good news is that the K-cups come in a variety of brands and coffees.  In addition, you can brew teas (try the Twinings teas) or hot chocolate.I recommend the following coffees:Caribou Blend K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108 ct.,Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Extra Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2),Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian, Decaffeinated, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2),Twinings English Breakfast Tea, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2),Twinings Earl Grey Tea K-Cups, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2),  Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Sumatran Reserve, andTimothy's World Coffee, Colombian, Decaffeinated, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2009", "summary": "Couldn't be easier!

My previous model had a silver button on top so you had to lift-up your finger and press down. Now you just press down and I prefer that.I do not prefer the counter stop storage solution of any of the frothers. I don't know about you, but space on my counter is very limited. Smaller frothers would perhaps more easily fit into a kitchen drawer.

I admit, I was pretty excited when Dyson released this product, but as most Dyson products, the T.V. commercials were better then the actual vacuum cleaner.  I should say up front that as you can see from all of previous reviews, I work in the vacuum cleaner industry, so I have more experience with different vacuums then the average Joe.Pro's:The vacuum has an on-board brush attachment for cleaning blinds, furniture, etc.  That's about the only good thing I can say about the machine.Con's:First the absolute biggest con is the price tag.  Most hand vacs sell for between $39-$79.  At about double that price, the Dyson DC16 sells for $150, the price of most manufacturers full sized upright or canister vacuums.  We have gotten MANY of these machines in for repairs, and after the first time I took apart and saw pea-sized motor in this vacuum I asked myself where is the $150?  I have come to the conclusion that more then half of the $150 is coming from the T.V. commercials Dyson runs for their products.The biggest problem that we are seeing on this machine is motor burning out.  The motor is cheap, Chinese made motor (don't let the British accent fool you) that runs at such a high RPM it burns itself out very quickly (if you can get the battery to last you that long).  Also if the filter in front of the motor is not cleaned regularly the motor will burn out quicker.If the vacuum cleaner actually cleaned well, I could justify the price, but for a cordless hand vac, the suction power is very weak.  The machine is extremely bulky, and will actually hurt your wrist if you use it for more then 5 minutes at a time.If I could have given this product a 0 star rating, or better yet a negative -5 rating, I would have.  This product is such a waste of money, please BEWARE OF THIS VACUUM.  We actually saw so many of these vacuum come back in for repair, or be returned that we actually stopped selling these vacuums, and are recondsidering our descision to sell Dyson vacuums period, because of the amount of repairs we are seeing.A much better choice for a hand vac would be a Black and Decker, or better yet my favorite hand vacDirtTamer V2510 Ultima Wet/Dry Hand Vacuum Cleaner Powerful Suction, and 2 Year Warranty!which at the price of the Dyson you can buy two of these vacuum for the price of 1 Dyson.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "02 13, 2009", "summary": "COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY, BUYER BEWARE!"}

Over a days worth of calories are housed in just one taco salad with a fried shell that you'd order out. However, you can get the same taste with these and be able to change up the ingredients inside the shell as well.For example, you can use queso or vegan queso rather than cheeseyou can use soy meat cooked with onions and taco seasoning rather than ground beefYou can add in a healthy monounsaturated fat with some avocado (although I don't overdo that as it still is a higher calorie item)I add in my favorite salsaYou can substitute refried beans for the meatSometimes I use fresh baby spinach rather than chopped lettuce for more nutrientsIn the winter, it is a great chili bowl with potatoes and your choice of cheeseAnd, better yet, you can keep several toppings in tupperware, cook the shells, and just let your family fix up their own with whatever they want in them for the easiest dinner ever.It creates a low calorie, low fat, whole meal in a bowl regardless of how you switch up what goes inside.I heat up the tortillas a few minutes in the microwave so they fit perfectly in the shell and are soft...then just follow the directions on the box and you have crisp taco shells in a few minutes.

It's also the one that seems designed to be used by heavy-duty users and/or professional chefs/cooks (as in a restaurant or other type of professional establishment).Depending on your needs and usage, this is either overpriced overkill or one of the best additions to your food-prep appliance line-up.From my perspective as an at-home, non-commercial cook who uses an immersion blender several times a week, here are the pros and cons:Pros:* Clean, stylized design. Most folks would have no problem keeping this on display (A plastic vertical, wall mounting unit is included.)* Ease of adding and using attachments. Unlike some immersion blenders, the whipping whisks and the main knife piece are easily attached to and deattached from the power base.The extra long 10-inch knife attachment is a plus or minus depending on the type/size of vessel that contains what you are trying to blend.* Sturdy--and substantial. The main unit and the attachments (especially the knife, which is the most heavy-duty type I've ever used) don't feel as if they will fall apart with frequent use. As always, a lot depends on how you treat items. We haven't dropped any of our other immersion blenders but the other two seem as if they would break a bit on hard impact, from a fall or otherwise. Not this unit!* Power: You can vary the blender attachment speed from low to high and it also includes a Turbo setting. We make a lot of soups and even the low speed made for fast, smooth (and spatter-proof) blending. Easy cleanup.You can also chop ice with the tri-blade knife and this is a feature I really use as it is faster (and requires less cleanup) than doing it in our old-style vertical blender.* Versatile: You've got the all the traditional uses with the knife and then there are the two whisks (Secured into a separate mounter that is easily attached to the power unit.)* Accessories: The tall pitcher makes it easy to blend/pour liquids (and we've also used it when whisking as well.) And I'm glad that it comes with a separate, extra large dual blade chopper unit as we are always looking for ways to avoid using our Cuisinart(heavy to drag out; a pain to clean as we don't have a dishwasher.)Depending on content, using the tall blending pitcher allows for some quick smoothies. And again, fast cleanup.Cons:* Size/weight: The extra-long knife attachment paired with the heavy power unit could make it less comfortable to use for some folks. However, given the speed of the unit, and average home-cook use, I doubt you'd have to use it long enough to have your hand get really tired. But it may be a consideration for some, so I point it out.* You need to be sure you're using a deep enough container when using the Turbo speed or you could have some splashing/mess. Also, you've got to hold the unit very firmly on Turbo or, again, a possible messy situation. In general, a firm grip is essential.* Cost: It's high for average home-cook use given other options on market. But, if your needs are heavy-duty in terms of both frequency and types of things you cook, it could be a solid investment piece for your kitchen.Why four, not five stars given all the pros? One basic consideration: Price. However, to repeat, if I were a professional chef or someone who prepared a lot more food (volume and frequency), this would be five-stars as this would be a good investment piece.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2012", "summary": "Powerful and versatile and maybe overkill for the average user"}

My XV-11, though, is not detected by Neato's firmware updater app on their website. I have followed every bit of advice on their site, I've tried multiple computers with different OSs, etc. The first time I contacted their support, they admitted they were having problems with Windows 8, so I figured I could wait a little bit and I put the upgrade kit in the closet, to come back to later. Then last week I tried again - this time with a clean install of Windows 8.1 - still no joy. So I tried another computer, Windows 7. Then another Win7 machine. I tried 3 different browsers. I tried everything. And support won't help me because the warranty is only good for a year after purchase. Seriously? I've spent over $600 on Neato products, including filters and this upgrade kit.

We are definitely glad we purchased the 13oz model since the size of this model already seems compact.  The construction seems to be made well, and the top has a good size opening to pour the soap.  Changing the batteries can be a bit awkward if you have soap in the unit since the batteries are inserted from the bottom, which means you have to turn the unit upside down to change the batteries.  I had to do this because I initially inserted the batteries in the opposite direction, so I turned the unit to the side without tipping it upside down as much as possible...no leaks, so that was good.  The amount of soap dispensed can be adjusted by pressing the &#34;+&#34; or &#34;-&#34; on the top of the unit.  Additionally, there is a low battery indicator on the top that will blink red when the batteries are getting low.We've been using this unit for only a few days, but we absolutely love it.  The spout that dispenses the soap is long enough to hang over the sink, which means wet hands will drip in the sink...excellent.  The brushed nickel on the outside looks sleek and stylish.  So far, there have been no leaks.  And, the sensor works flawlessly.  There was lavender soap included with the unit, which actually smells very good...so good that we are likely going to purchase additionally lavender soap, although we may look for a different brand since the Simplehuman brand is very expensive.After using this unit, we are so spoiled, that we intend to purchase several more in order to replace the remaining manual pump dispensers in the house.  The manual dispensers are messy and water goes all over the sink when using them, unlike with this unit.  Additionally, if you have anything on your hands that could contain bacteria, with this unit, you don't have to touch anything and potentially infect others.

Several nights, I've woken up to the machine still going when I expected it to turn itself off hours before. I wish the power button was back-lit so the times when I have to unexpectedly hurry to the machine in the dark to turn it off manually, I don't have to stumble around feeling the machine or turn on the house lights to turn it off. The timer works fine when I use it to go off at a longer time (8-9 hours). I still haven't figured out exactly what the sweet spot is for the timer to stop working.I've always left the machine on \"auto\", but have never heard it adjust its fan speed. It's always running at the highest setting no matter how long it's been on or how the temperature in the room might have changed.

I'm using it now to make juice to drink but also for making sorbet and ice cream with my new Cuisinart Ice-21 (had it only two months but using it 3-4 days a week, and also so far, so good: http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-ICE-21-Frozen-Yogurt-Ice-Sorbet/dp/B003KYSLMW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344879775&sr;=8-1&keywords;=cuisinart+ice+21). I keep wondering when it's going to break down because it seems so cheaply made - well, it is, but it's also well made. I think the important thing is to give it a slight rest when juicing a lot of fruit so the motor doesn't get too hot (that advice also may be in the manual - can't remember, can't find the manual). It's very easy to use, to put together and take apart and clean, the pitcher is very handy (though the markings for the volume are almost invisible - 16 oz. is about halfway up the little transparent window).

The pan itself had a soft, yet firm grip, was not slippery, has deep muffin cups, and I love how cheery the color of the pan is as well! The pan was also very ample in size, larger than the varieties of pans that I usually find at my local department stores or at local craft stores, such as Joann Fabrics. What an even nicer surprise, is that the pan, compared to other silicone pans I've purchased, did not come with any offensive plastic odor, and was immediately ready for baking!I then set out to make one of my families favorites, my recipe for Triple Berry Breakfast Muffins:Ingredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3/4 cup sugar1/2 teaspoon kosher salt2 teaspoons baking powder1/3 cup vegetable oil1 large egg1/3 cup reduced fat milk1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract1 cup fresh berries; I use a medley of blueberries, raspberries, and cranberries.Instructions:1) Heat oven to 400 degrees2) Next, combine flour, 3/4 cup of the sugar, baking powder and the salt in a large bowl with a whisk. Whisk at least 10 times to make sure the baking powder and salt have evenly dispersed.3) Add vegetable oil to a measuring glass.4) Add the egg to the measuring glass, and incorporate; while incorporating add your vanilla extract.5) Add milk mixture to the bowl with flour and sugar then use a fork to combine. Do not over mix.6) Fold in your berries.7) Divide batter between 8 muffin cups; I used my OvenArt Silicone Bakeware Muffin Pan. As I am using silicone, you will not need to use liners (unless giving to others), or add water to the bottom of your muffins.8) Bake muffins 15 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter.9) Once done, tip your OvenArt Silicone Bakeware Muffin Pan on its side, and your muffins will simply fall out!10) Transfer muffins to a cooling rack and cool completely.11) To store muffins, place them in a plastic bag, seal, and store at room temperature for up to 2 to 3 days, or freeze tightly wrapped for up to 3 months.The muffins came out cleanly, without burning, and the pan was a cinch to clean up!

I tried all the troubleshooting tips in the manual but none were effective. I then called Vornado's customer service line. I explained my situation and the rep quickly told me that I would be unable to fix the unit. I provided my units serial number. She said that she would send me a replacement unit. Vornado only required that I email them a photo of the unit with the power cord clipped to process my claim. I was so happy that I was not required to ship the broken unit back to Vornado. My replacement unit arrived within five days.  I am thrilled with Vornado's prompt customer service!Now on to my review:This unit is large and designed to work for a room up to 335 square feet. The unit measures about 28 inches high, 12 inches wide and the depth in about 11 1/2 inches. With those measurements this unit is a large presence in a room. Build quality is nice though it is largely plastic. The glossy black finish attracts dust so you will need to wipe it down daily to keep it looking nice.The unit has many nice features. It has two HEPA filters and two carbon filter. The filters are the replaceable only type. The unit has filter change indicators for each filter type. The indicators are based on how many hours the unit is run. The carbon filter is designed for 4000 hours. The HEPA is designed for 9000 hours. The indicators are NOT based on the dirtiness of the filters. The filters are easily changed as they are right behind the front cover. The control buttons illuminate to a bright blue color. The unit automatically dims its illumination after a short time, it will brighten if you touch any button. The unit has low,med,high and a quick clean mode. There is also a dust sensing mode. The dust sensing mode defaults to a lower setting but ramps up when dust is detected. There is also a nighttime setting that detects low or no lighting in the room. It will then power the unit down to the low setting  I also like that this unit does not have an ionizer. Many people are sensitive to the effects of an ionizer. This is a large unit so it is loud on the higher settings.Performance wise I am very happy with the unit. I have a small one bedroom condo but I have five cats. The five cats and their five litter boxes produce lots of dust,dander,hair and filth. I love the dust sensing mode! Every Time one of my cats goes into the litterbox and kicks up dust this unit senses it and kicks into action clearing the air! It also does the same when I scoop the boxes. The bedroom where I run this unit and have the litter boxes has  much fresher and cleaner air.I only have a few quibbles with this machine. I worry that it may greatly affect my energy bill since it is NOT an energy saver model. I will update my review regarding that issue after I receive my next bill. I recently checked the current cost of the replacement filters and they are quite high. I am hoping I can find cheaper off brand filters when the time comes to replace them.Overall, I love the unit and the results that I am experiencing. I am also happy that the company stands behind its product. I will update my review in few months.****EXTRA INFORMATION****I also have the smaller model Vornado AC300. The AC300 is half the height of this unit and about half the cost. It also uses one HEPA filter and one carbon filter (same filters as the AC500) but it has less features. It is rated for a 225 square foot room. I just want to suggest perhaps think about getting two of the smaller units if you have a large home or you are concerned about the size of the larger unit.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2014", "summary": "Do you have a dusty home ?

Trying to hold the lid shut to keep the coffee in does not stop this.

Just that blue button to push on. And apparently it doesn't need that, sometimes.

After years of owning several steam (\"el cheapo\") types of machines, I finally bit the bullet and asked for a pump style two years ago for Christmas.  I received a Delonghi and really loved it.  (After all it was a HUGE improvement over what I had owned in the past.) It finally bit the dust in September of this year.  (Not quite two years old... but I do use it everyday, sometimes multiple times...) I did my research and decided to buy this one locally, really because I needed it NOW!  (I mentioned I use it everyday....) My first attempt started rather well, I like the design, the water basin is great, you can remove it, but you don't have to.  The unit heats up very quickly and pulls a great cup of espresso and then the frothing feature is amazing...  I have never owned a more powerful unit.  My Delonghi could froth well, but nothing like this bad boy.  I found that my standard sized frothing pitcher was not near large enough.  I can only froth 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of 1% at a time or I get serious overload.  Since I need a whole cup frothed for my drink, I am having to froth two or three times for one drink.  I understand that this is not the fault of the machine, I am thrilled that it has the power to create froth as well as the coffee houses do.  However, I am concerned about being able to find a larger pitcher that is not too deep as the frothing wand is not very long and extends pretty low on the side of the machine.  This feature alone is not enough to cause my star rating to drop to four.  As I mentioned in my title, this is round two for me.  About three weeks after I purchased my first unit, I had a day when the machine seemed to \"flip out\". I was pulling the shot of espresso, it started sputtering and making a weird noise.  I turned the knob to the off position and pushed the froth button and all seemed to go fine, then I thought I would try to pull another shot just to be sure it was working.  I started over with new beans and all went fine.  So then I went to froth the remaining milk and the frothing feature would not work!  I would push the froth button, it would flash a few times and then switch itself to the shot light and you could pull another shot, but not froth.  Later in the day, I tried it again and it seemed to work fine, but after that it began to leak like a sieve on my counter.  So, I took it back.  I exchanged it for the same unit and I notice it leaks a bit too, but not like the other one.  I like the taste and quality of the espresso I brew so much I will not be taking it back for the puddle it creates, but I sure wish it didn't do that!**Edit** After reading some of the reviews, I decided to try to remove the black rubber tip from the frothing tube.  This did NOT work for me.  It still steamed, but it did not froth at all.  One of the biggest perks of this machine for me is the high frothing output obtained when steaming.  So, I promptly returned the rubber tip to it's rightful place.  Just remember to take it off daily to clean under it, it will get nasty if you don't.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2010", "summary": "This is round number two for me!"}

My criteria was cost less than $150 with a insulated carafe.The most important thing is that when I fill the reservoir with cold tap water, the water consistently comes out between 185 and 190 degrees F when it hits the grinds.  In the pot, it measures about 175 degrees.  Preheating the carafe would probably prevent the 10 degree temperature drop, but seriously, who has time to do that in the morning?The coffee stays pretty hot for at least 3 hours.  As an experiment, I drank half the pot (about 2-3 mugs) and came back 3 hours later to measure the temperature and it was 160 degrees.  At 6 hours, it was 130 degrees... a bit too cool, but who wants to drink 6 hour old coffee anyway?  I'm guessing most people will drink a pot of coffee in 2 hours or less (we do), and the carafe will definitely keep your coffee hot.I use this machine twice a day, in the morning with the timer and then in the evening with manual start.  I've used this coffee maker daily for 3 months with not a single overflow incident that others have commented on.  Despite what people have said, there is no need to precisely center the carafe under the filter basket.  It's designed with a lot of wiggle room, so I'm not sure what others are doing that causes the machine to spill coffee everywhere.  Perhaps accidentally placing 2 paper filters instead of one?  Even with a full basket of fine espresso ground beans, I didn't see any overflow from the basket, or grinds in the coffee.  I haven't tried brewing with 2 filters, mainly because I have no desire to purposely cause a spillover and mop up the counter.The timer and controls are intuitive and simple to operate.  The reservoir window is large and it's easy to quickly see how much water is in it.  The filter basket pulls out for easy cleaning.The only thing that is partially aggravating is that if the lid to the carafe is screwed closed too tight before brewing, it's nearly impossible to unscrew to pour coffee out. I guess the plastic lid expands slightly from the heat, and it becomes the equivalent of opening up a vacuum sealed jar.  The simple fix:  don't close the lid too tight.  Works great.This is a well engineered and effective machine that works quite well and brews a great cup of coffee.  My wife and I use it daily, we've had no problems, and are very happy with this purchase.

My wife and I decided that we likely used it 5-10 a day for 10 years. We discovered our dependence on the MW between the kaput and the receiving this one.Before choosing this one, we read and considered user reviews. On the 1-5 rating scale and a lot of reviewers in the distribution it&#8217;s still a crap shoot. Most negative views regard the dial control or DOA&#8217;s.Ours worked fine right out of the box. There are little things we notice that make this a step function improvement:1. Popcorn &#8211; pops all the corn it appears and outputs a fluffier product without that super-heated steam blast that used to deliver 2nd degree burns to the knuckles when you open the bag.2. Inverter defrost &#8211; 10 years ago this was iffy for thawing hard frozen chicken or steak before grilling. Now, I&#8217;m getting a uniform thaw. Whatever the sensor improvements over time, inverter defrost works as one would expect.3. Sensor reheat &#8211; My default button. However, the old one could turn soup to molten lava if you left the machine to its devices too long. Not anymore. Panasonic has succeeded in calibrating the sensor heat for humans rather than lava dragons. You have a sensor reheat button for frozen stuff and another button for room temp reheat. These are on the top button row and are basically the only two buttons I&#8217;ll need.4. The dial &#8211; It&#8217;s a touch sensitive, intuitive device.  It doesn&#8217;t stick out. It&#8217;s not a knob. It&#8217;s superior to the old touchpad that seemed to take its origin from a programmable flight computer.Now I like farm machinery and there&#8217;s a lot of farm tech that I&#8217;d like in the house. With farm equipment &#8230; the Big Green button is on. The Big Red button is off. I really understand that. There are only 2 options between full blast and off. Unfortunately, the household MW requires a spectrum of options dependent on the MW target food and the user desire. If Panasonic could build a sensor that used an AI to know what I&#8217;m nuking and the way I want it &#8230; we could have those big Red and Green buttons.

In practice this isn't as helpful as I expected.  My oven mitts are too thick to fit well in the holes and the placement of the holes means I have to be careful not to overfill them or my food will bubble over and through the holes.The shape of the \"handles\" and holes also means it is more difficult to cover the bakers if I want to keep the leftovers in the dish and put it in the refrigerator or freezer -- you can't just put aluminum foil or plastic wrap tightly over the top of the baker.

There's a couple of things that can really be frustrating:  1) If the handle falls out a lot.  2) If the clamp doesn't clamp the machine onto the table tight enough. and 3) If the noodle cutter doesn't cut well.  Any of those three can make for a really frustrating experience.The problem with this machine is #1: the handle falls out a lot. The machine is very lightweight and doesn't feel as if it's made that well and the thickness adjusting knob feels flimsy.  But, you have to think about the price you're paying and so I understand that.  It's reasonable quality for the price.  BUT, the handle doesn't go in all the way on the roller (as far as it should).  It only went in about half way on the roller part.  And it went in far enough on the angel hair cutter, but not on the fettucine cutter.  So, this pasta maker would be really frustrating--because the majority of your turning is the rolling part--making the dough thinner and thinner.My recommendation is that if you're looking for a good pasta maker that won't frustrate you, then I think you'd be wise to choose a different one.  I do know that sometimes there are quality control issues with things and perhaps mine is just defective.  So, please read the other reviews to see what the general experience with this pasta maker is.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2008", "summary": "Will Frustrate You..."}

The best tenderizer I've used.5. Easy to store, wit a protective cover to prevent any accidental cuts or harm from the blade.6. Allows you to save money, making less tender cuts of meat come out as tender as more expensive ones.Now, a personal opinion. If you ARE going to tenderize your meat, please avoid adding salt to your marinade if you can avoid it. I think it draws out the juices and makes for a less flavorful and tender cut of meat. If you want your meat to be salty, just add it after your first bite, adjusting to your taste.Also, please let the meat rest for a good 5 minutes after you take it from the oven. If you cut it before then, you may have one good slice of meat (the first one) but the juices will flow out and the rest of the pieces will be less tender. So let the meat sit and let the juices settle a bit. You'll be glad you did.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2005", "summary": "So simple to use and the results are incredible"}

However, if you do not want it, then you probably ought to look into cloth filters.

I'm thinking that the problems first mentioned in the bad reviews have been taken care of. I own an inexpensive Aroma brand yogurt maker that has been in constant use every week for several years now and had been marvelous, so I thought I would go for their electric kettle as well. It is my first electric kettle, so I didn't want to spend too much money to figure out what worked best for me. I'm very pleased with this purchase.Of all the things mentioned that were potentially bad about this Aroma Kettle, the only one we have noticed is the noise. It IS loud when heating up, but for me it's a good thing, because I often forget to plug it in and no noise is my indicator that I need to get over there and do it. It's not loud enough to wake up the grand baby, but it makes the dogs perk up from a sleep and I can hear it from two rooms away. Like I said, this is a plus for me because I usually set it up and leave the room.I have some nasty arthritis and this kettle being so light is a real plus and I don't look at it as a sign of cheapness. It is built solid, doesn't drip when pouring. The lid stays attached but opens all the way and has a catch that holds it open instead of flopping closed on you. It can't be filled from the fridge water dispenser, but I never use that anyway, (we keep open water jugs that have out-gassed of chlorine for coffee, tea, plants and doggies). I leave the lid open so it can dry out after use and have seen no rust.The water level indicator is located behind the handle and isn't that easy to see, but really, who cares. If it's that important you can see it or use a measuring cup. The handle is very comfortable for my arthritic hands and wrists, and placed well for balance.I wish it had a longer cord, but it seems that none of them do. The cord length is 29\" and can be shortened by wrapping it in the underside of the base to the desired shorter length so you don't have excess cord on your counter.There are some very expensive electric kettles out there and I am sure they are wonderful, but this Aroma Kettle is perfect for our use.

They cook in less time than the old fashioned boiling way, saving me time.  Making an egg sandwich is no longer the chore, but simple to do.Once you get the timing with your Microwave down, you can count on it for consistency and ease.

You can also use your own box or bowl, but this one fits so nicely (and holds 2 liters) that you will probably end up using it most of the time. It fits nicely over the scale as a cover, so you can keep it right with the scale.This is the smaller of the Smart Weigh scales and will weigh up to 2000 grams (in US terms, that is a little over 4 1/2 pounds). Since a majority of my weighing needs fall into this capacity, it is perfect in my kitchen, whether measuring fruit for canning or measuring the quantity of food I am supposed to be consuming. However, if you need something larger, Smart Weigh does offerSmart Weigh CSB5KG Cuisine Digital Scale with Removable Bowl 11lbs / 5000g x 1g - Blackwhich weighs items up to 11 pounds.It includes clear instructions - and is very simple to use. I love the ease of doing &#34;tare weight&#34; because you simply put the bowl (or other item) on the scale before turning it on. It automatically begins your weight at -0-. The Mode (M) allows you to quickly move between ounces and grams (as wells as ozt and dwt). Since many recipe books include the gram weight of foods, having it available is very handy.Something important is the ability to calibrate the scale if it gets out of calibration.All in all, this is not only an accurate scale but it is also easy to use and works nicely in the kitchen.I received a complimentary sample to test for my review.

I was immediately disappointed with the performance of this Hamilton Beach 76606Z Smooth Touch Can Opener.  Having known the Hamilton Beach brand as one with a reputation of making great quality products, and also having owned several Hamilton Beach products over the years; my expectation was dashed on seeing how poorly designed and sloppy this can opener was, I must say it looked very cute, and that's the best I will say about it here. I first tested it with a simple can of beans (non microwavable) that I had used the old can opener to open in less than 10 seconds with its magnetic clamp holding the cut away piece cleanly. This new Hamilton Beach notwithstanding it's cuteness when put it to the test to open the \"same\" can of beans failed to get the job done; instead it kept spinning around and around, leaving a nice pattern on the edge of the can. I am an engineer, but I did not want to waste my time seeing what exactly was the \"design\" flaws, all I know it could not perform the simple task of opening a can that I bought to do. I made sure I read the manual which was not much, but it validated that I was doing everything exactly right as per the operator's expectation. That was enough to tell me that this can opener obviously was not working. I did notice that it did not have a \"can puncture\" mechanism that all can openers I previously owned had, but that is not a concern: my concern is that it works properly, and it did not. I re-consulted the manual and noticed where the manufacturer stated that this can opener will not open certain type of cans, such indicated to me it was a much more finicky can opener that I am accustomed to, if technological advances of any kind is made and it does not improve performance it is just a R&D fad to sell something as \"new\" and latest, \"a can opener, is a can opener, is a can opener,\" it should be able to open \"cans\" so to speak: whether it is electric, or manually operated, it shouldn't take a rocket science degree to operate, nor should the customer be subjugated to using, chewing gum, rubber bands, and refrigerator magnets, to customized it in order to get it to work: such is totally unacceptable.

This throw is a great way to keep warm without feeling weighed down or constricted -- it's just as effective as a heavyweight faux fur throw (a Pottery Barn purchase) is and much more comfortable. The microsuede side is particularly nice; the other side feels like a light artificial fabric mix designed to imitate silk. It's not nasty, but it's not as pleasant a feel (and if you use this on your bed with this side down, it can slide off more easily.) The filling (not down) doesn't shift in use (the big negative of my down duvet) and doesn't bunch up when it's washed.The only downside for me is that even at 5'2\", I would have preferred a slightly longer throw. As it is, if I stretch out for a nap, I have to choose between keeping my shoulders or my toes warm. That's the reason for the 4-star rather than 5-star rating. But right now I'm using it to compensate for the shifting down in my duvet cover; I keep the bedroom below 60 degrees at night, and pulling this up around my shoulders means I wake up comfortably warm however chilly it is outdoors.

If you have one of these stoves you know how important it is to have compatible cookware.It's a breeze to clean. Either machine wash, or simply dunk it in hot, soapy water, rinse and towel dry.A few things to keep in mind: (1) be careful with the heat. If you go above a medium setting (somewhere around 325 or so) eggs will stick and it does become less easy to clean. (2) Resist the temptation to scramble an egg with a metal fork (and for me it was a temptation until I ruined one of these). The best companion purchase you can make with this pan is aNorpro Nylon Mini Spatula.Finally the price is right.

It comes in two pieces: a metal rack and hard, breakable clean drain pan.1) While the clean drain pan has indentations for the drainer rack's feet, it has no way to drain water to the sink. No holes, no lip, nothing.  Nada.  The lip is shallow and the pan fills quickly.  You have to stop everything when the water in the pan is close to the edge, manually dry the dishes in the rack, and then tip the pan into the sink. FAIL.2) While this does hold small, light weight plastic dishes, cups and glasses, its sleek low lines are unable to support glass, pottery or china.  That Pyrex baking dish? sure, if its the only thing going in the rack.  So for versatility: FAIL.3) The utensil caddy is, to quote Dorothy Parker, had me thinking &#34;what fresh H*ll is this?&#34;  The caddy is a molded section of the drain board pan (that doesn't drain)  with a couple side holes to allow for water to escape.  This means that your knife points, spoon handles and fork handles are in contact with water collecting from the stuff in the rack.  The idea of a dish drainer is to let the water drip off, not to have things standing in the water.  So from a logic standpoint, FAIL.4) Materials look good, but they are impractical.  The hard drain pan is shiny and clear, and if you keep it washed and dried with a soft cloth, it looks bad.  As for the rack, there is no way I would put a good china in it its hard and unforgiving basket, or on one of the rigid short cup holders. Materials: FAILI want very much to like the products that I am fortunate enough to try, but this went into the trash after trying to use it a couple times.  It is a clean design made by someone without regard for functionality, or the weight of various cooking and eating surfaces.  It comes with no instructions for its care, or an explanation of why it has no drain when it has a DRAIN BOARD as one of its main pieces, much like a washing machine with no hose to empty the washing chamber.So my one star review should be taken to mean that this is an epic fail of a product.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2014", "summary": "Epic, Design and product FAIL"}

It was easy to prepare and the yogurt came out perfect.I used 2% milk and 2% Fage Yogurt as starter. I boiled the milk as recommended in the manual, then set the pot in a sink half filled with cold water, and used a candy thermometer (a thermometer is NOT included with this unit) to see when the milk's temp was about 110F, at which point I added the starter.There are many, many sites on the web where people discuss homemade yogurt making, and some insist that it's better to use only a few tablespoons of starter yogurt as opposed to a whole cup (the manual recommends using a cup to 9 cups of milk). That may be so, but my first batch with this unit came out perfect even though I used an entire 7 ounce container of Fage. (I found this site particularly helpful to refer to when I was familiarizing myself with the process of making yogurt: makeyourownyogurt dot com.)The only problem I had was due to my impatience at waiting for 9 cups of milk to boil. I set the temp on my stove to medium high as it says to in the instructions, but after a half an hour of watching and occasionally stirring it with a whisk my patience ran out and I turned the heat up full blast. The milk boiled quickly after that, so quickly that it boiled over before I could stop it and I also ended up with scalded milk on the bottom of the pot. (For great ideas on how to remove scalded milk from the bottoms of stainless pots, see this site: thriftyfun dot com backslash tf569266 dot tip - sorry to write out dot and backslash but in my experience Amazon doesn't tend to allow urls.)What you do NOT get with this unit that you will need to use it as recommended in the manual is a thermometer suitable for checking the temp of boiled milk, a pot in which to boil the milk, a whisk, yogurt starter, and of course milk. What you do get is a set of containers, a strainer for converting the yogurt you make into Greek style yogurt, a unit that keeps the yogurt-in-process warm at the right temp, and a built in digital timer (and the timer is the only thing that makes this unit \"digital\"). One can of course buy all those things separately and many of us own timers and crock pots and other kitchen gadgets useful for making homemade yogurt, and many people of course do make homemade yogurt without using a yogurt maker (and the site I mention above, makeyourownyogurt dot com is all about making yogurt without a yogurt maker), so what this unit gives you is convenience (or not if storing the unit when it's not in use would prove to be inconvenient for you).When in use on a counter, the unit takes up about 9 1/2\" x 11 1/2\", which is only a little bigger than the footprint of a sheet of printer paper. It's nice looking, and the six included jars are glass with blue plastic lids. The larger container is plastic and any yogurt prepared in it is meant to be transferred to another container. The straining process is very easy and the whey that is strained out can be used in all kinds of ways and thus doesn't have to be discarded and wasted (and there are many, many sites devoted to the topic of how to use leftover whey; you can freeze leftover whey AND you can freeze the yogurt you make with the Oster Mykonos Greek Digital Yogurt Maker).Would make a great gift for someone who might not be inclined to start making their own yogurt without the help of a yogurt maker. And making your own yogurt is certainly a heck of a lot cheaper than buying yogurt in a store, especially Greek yogurt. Many people complain that most store-bought flavored yogurt contains sugar or too much sugar.

Its very cute and I love how the mist comes out the nose.  I also like how you can see the mist unlike in our Vicks one.  So we ordered it for our baby's room.I decided to pack it up and return it after the 2nd night.  I followed all the recommendations in the manual and used filtered water. I would also empty it in the morning.  When I would put it on at night, I'd see the mist and it seemed to be working in adding moisture to the air.  But when my husband or I would check on our daughter in the middle of the night or in the morning, there was no longer any mist coming out.  I put my hand on the mister to see if it moist air was still coming out and would feel nothing, hardly even feeling air.  The manual says that it can last up to 10 hours and we never had it running that long.  Plus the tank would still have most of the water in it when it would stop misting.Maybe we just got a defective one.

All four have to be removed to get into the battery compartment. I had to try several small screwdrivers to find one that worked. The screws are so small, they are difficult to handle. It was an annoying task just to be able to use the timer.The second problem is that the magnets attached to the back are too weak to hold the timer on my refrigerator door. The door works fine with regular magnets, but the timer is too heavy to stick. It slides down the door.The product itself is water resistant and can be dropped without damage.

Glass-like Lid with a silicon gasket to snap tight on the main container to create a spill-proof lunch box3. Sauce container4. Dish container5. Fork with a thick edge on one side that acts like a pseudo-knifeConcept-wise it makes sense. Apart from the main container, they provide two more containers. A small one to house your sauce so foods don't end up getting soggy. You also have a bigger container that fits inside that acts as a separator from hot and cold foods in the same box by simply removing the container that houses the cold food before you microwave the rest.All of these in an attractively designed, BPA-free product.WHAT'S WRONG?1. You can't microwave longer than 2 minutes to prevent any part of the product from warping. Shorter times are even required for oily foods. The main container even has this 2-minute warning. Depending on the food, my lunch comes out partly hot and partly cold due to the short duration that I need to go past 2 minutes each and every time.2. The glass-like LID looks great when new. After a few uses there are scratches from normal handling. It also gets warped easily when handling warm foods that are dumped in the container then sealed. Despite the small silicon vent, a vacuum is still created and you'll have to force the lid to separate from the container at times and then find the lid in a slightly concave shape that impedes on getting a tight fit.3. Handles on the lid break easily due to a pathetic thin plastic part that holds the hinges. As you can read from the other reviews, it is a problem. The company is aware of the defect and has quietly launched a replacement lid program. You will have to take the initiative to contact Black + Blum's customer support so they provide you with the link to register for the replacement lid. This is poor customer service rather than an announcement from their home page. As of this writing at least no open announcement has been done on their website or found on their FAQ section at least.4. The plastic fork that acts like a pseudo-knife, just like the poorly designed lid, can't handle any cutting work other than already easy to separate foods like salads, fruits, vegetables and sushi. Any plastic fork can do that job. What I need is a tougher manufactured fork as mine is pretty scratched up as well with just less than 2 months of daily use.5. The two containers when used at the same time pretty much occupies the whole main container and nothing else can pretty much fit. So when I need to use a container, I only use one of these so I can fit more of my main food item. Otherwise, I don't use the containers at all.CONCLUSION:Although customer response is quick to provide an answer by simply giving me the link to register, I'm not impressed with the overall performance of the product. It looks good on paper, but not really impressive for daily use. The original hinges have snapped which brought me back to my trusty old Ziplock containers that have taken abuse and is still going strong.I'm still waiting for the replacement lid which they confirmed to have processed and will be shipping soon. The hinges are now soft so they don't break and snap apart.After this experience with the product, I'm staying away from Black + Blum products. Sure they can create wonderfully designed products, but until they can build quality into it as well their just turning customers away in the process.This review will be updated once I receive the replacement lid.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "06 10, 2011", "summary": "Good Concept, Poor Execution and Build Quality"}

The construction is almost commercial grade and yet it is light enough to easily clean and move.The first big question is if you really need a big fryer. This fryer uses roughly one gallon of oil. The minimum level is slightly less - I feel like, if you're pouring oil, why not just add that extra quart and fill the thing all the way up? It will cook French fries for a family of four, easily. Aside from disposing of all that oil, the other big downside is the smell of fryer oil in the house. There is no carbon filter on this fryer, so it gives off a good strong fry smell. Of course you could place it near a range hood to exhaust the smell. I've used a small one-quart fryer that cooks roughly one serving of food for a long time. That fryer has a charcoal filter and avoids a lot of the nasty fryer oil smell. The downside, you have to keep fried foods warm if you are cooking for more than one person.If you are sold on a big fryer, this one is super sweet. The metal bowl is extruded stainless steel that is super easy to clean and built like commercial kitchen utensils (not necessarily pretty, but rugged). There is a valve at the front of the bowl to drain the cool oil. That valve is covered with a fine mesh stainless steel screen that prevents particulate from draining. The heating unit is a standard well built metal loop, exactly the style used in commercial fryers. DeLonghi did a nice job with the control unit and heating element in one assembly that is easy to place inside the fryer bowl. The stainless steel base is well designed. There are handles in the front and side to allow easy lifting of the hot fryer. There is a front door covering the drain.The lid looks pretty, I'm not sure I'm a major fan of the design though. The front window is large and it is easy to see inside the fryer. There is a plastic handle that makes it easy to open the lid. The problem with the design, the vent holes are just behind the handle. When you remove the top, there is an opportunity for you hands to get a little hot from the rising steam. If they put the handle in front of the viewing glass, the problem would be solved. There isn't anyplace to hang the lid when you remove it. You have to put the lid on the counter or someplace else while adding or removing food. Given all the though put into everything else, I would like some kind of hook.The basket is outstanding. The handle snaps in solidly and has no play. The stainless steel mesh is fine with good clean welds. The whole thing has a good solid feel to it.Oil heated very quickly, this is a high wattage fryer. The controls are a little quirky. The temperature increases in 9 Fahrenheit degree increments - the design is really meant for degrees centigrade. The timer is limited to whole minutes. Once the fryer reaches the preset temperature, you start the timer by pressing the power button. You turn off the unit by unplugging it. It didn't take long to get used to the controls, they're odd but not too odd.There is a lard mode that heats the oil slowly to allow the lard to melt. Lard mode also resets the oil timer (a ten hour timer to tell you when to change the oil).The dual zone concept is mostly all marketing. In theory the bottom of the fryer is supposed to be cool and not burn flakes of food that have settled to the bottom of the tank. Food burns just like any other fryer. That cold zone is actually just a small standoff for the heating element. Oil is slightly cooler at the bottom, but not dramatically cooler.A few minor quirks aside, this is an outstanding fryer. I've used a lot of commercial fryers, and this one is almost at that level. I like the details they added to this fryer.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2014", "summary": "Almost Commercial Grade"}

Since there is a small output of smoke during grilling, I just place the grill on a thick wooden cutting board, on the stovetop (obviously with the burners in the off position) and with the stovetop hood on to remove smoke and odors; it's pretty effective.Cleanup is relatively simple due to the grill's nonstick surface and takes just a few minutes.

I grew disillusioned with my Oxo Liqui-Seal mug, and saw recommendations for this cup on those reviews.This Thermos Nissan keeps my drinks much hotter than the plastic-lined Oxo cup ever did, and does not retain flavors in the liner, so I can use it for hot tea and other drinks after drinking coffee from it.The lid is a much simpler design, basically a circular insert that screws down to shut, and screws 1/2 turn to open.  The best part about the lid is that there are no crevices or little openings to harbor residue from coffee with milk or cream.  The Oxo cup quickly developed on off-flavor, since there was no way to thoroughly clean it, but this Nissan cup has a very straightforward design, and is totally cleanable!  That was my #1 criteria for a cup.  It is also totally spill-proof, another criteria for this busy mom and teacher.  It has been knocked over several times on my desk at school, without spilling a drop.  It is not as easy to open one-handed (ie while driving) as some other cups, but that is not my primary use for it, so that hasn't been a big deal.The rubber grips on the cup and the rubberized handle are both easy to hold onto, even with gloves on.  It fits easily in my car cup-holder, and is not overly top-heavy or wobbly on a desk.It is easy to clean; they recommend washing by hand, but I confess that I've put in the dishwasher a couple of times on particularly busy days, with no ill effects.The one and only thing I don't like is that you cannot tell by looking at the lid whether it is open or closed.  The only way to know is to either try screwing it open or shut, or to attempt to take a drink.  I quickly developed the habit of screwing it shut immediately after every drink, however, so I know it is always closed.Overall, this is the best insulated travel cup I've ever owned (and I have a cupboard full!).

Its large capacity water tanks make for less times per week of filling it up. The two reservoir tanks make it very convenient when filling because since you can leave one in place on the humidifier you do not have to turn it off when refilling it. I have found that it does not empty the tanks evenly as it runs but empties one tank and them moves on to the other one after the first is empty. So this makes it to where when you check on how empty it is by just gently lifting the handle of each tank to see if they are very light indicating that they are empty or very close to it. Then you just grab the empty one and refill is while there is one tank absent and the other is still making the machine run without interruption. This feature makes it much easier to gauge how much water is in it at any given time. Also, this unit automatically powers down when both tanks become empty so that it does not just run and run with no water in it and damage itself. The last two humidifiers I have had that were Vick's brand did not have this automatic feature and it made it to where you had to watch it on a regular basis to make sure it was not running with no water in the reservoir. The controls on this unit are very accessible, straightforward, and are marked very clearly for quick adjustments to the settings. The two control knobs and all indicators are on the top of the unit so you can easily see them and adjust them.This Honeywell unit is large and that makes for bigger and better venting of the discharged humidified air so that it does its job much more effectively. And even with it being a bigger and heavier unit, the fact that it has casters on it makes moving it around as easy as can be. This also allows for moving it to a workable are easily when it is time to clean it. The filter is very effective and since it can be rinsed out once and reused it makes it to where you do not have to buy a new filter every time it gets a bit dirty. So, given that, you only have to replace it every other time of cleaning the unit. I am the type that is very meticulous about keeping machinery, appliances, and other devices very clean because it makes them last longer and work more efficiently. This unit is a snap to clean because the entire top comes off along with the two reservoir tanks so that you can put the base in the dishwasher lying flat on the bottom rack and let the dishwasher disinfect and really clean it well. Then when you put it back together it is so easy because there are no screws or fasteners that have to be taken out or disengaged to take it apart for cleaning. The device housing and two reservoir tanks just lift off for easy access to the base tray for cleaning. The design and style of this unit makes it to where it is not unsightly but actually is very graceful and attractive when in any room. It is not like some of the other humidifiers that are on the market that are so ugly and unattractive that you would rather keep it hidden to where it is out of sight.The machine does have a level of operating sound coming from it when running, but it actually is a pleasant and even sound that is not a nuisance to the ears and is not so loud that you have to turn the TV up in the room with the humidifier to be able to hear it. My overall view of this unit is that it is the best humidifier that I have ever owned and I am very happy to have taken the time to really check out a lot of different humidifiers online before purchasing this one. The time and effort spent researching and comparing really paid off. I would recommend this humidifier to anyone that needs one for office or household use.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2012", "summary": "Very Efficient & Effective Humidifier"}

There is a space in the bottom for two AA batteries, and a switch for changing between Lbs and Metric measurements. It has a 6 pound weight limit. The front has a large LCD and a button for ON and OFF.Pro:The glass provides a good surface and can be cleaned  under water. It removes easily.The scale allows one to first put the container on the scale, then hold the ON button until the scale zeros out. This enables the user to weigh the ingredients easily. And of one is combining ingredients, then it is simple - just hit the ON button again for each added ingredient. Nice and simple.The instructions are graphical, but were fairly easy for me to figure out. There are warnings about keeping it level and making sure it is on a steady surface. The sequence of pictures to show how to zero out the scale after placing a container on the scale were well done.Con:I would be a bit worried about the glass breaking, but then again one just needs to take care of it.

Cons: I agree the packing left much to be desired. All the pieces were scraping against each other inside the carton for their entire journey to my front porch. Fortunately the only major damage did not show after assembly. As others mentioned, it does have a bit of a smell but it did not give me a headache and I did not need to air it out for 3 weeks; smells like fresh paint to me. Assembly was moderately easy (I'm not good at such things). I was suprised at how few pieces there were.  The whole front panel (the door and hinges) was pre-assembled except for the knobs (which I will change out).  The bottom panel was supposed to slide into a groove but due to poor craftsmanship it did not meet up with the groove. End result was that the entire cabinet is slightly wobbly because it affected slightly the rest of the assembly. One of the pre-attached doors hangs a bit off-kilter, but it does not affect opening or closing and is not unsightly. The bottom and side panels are kind of thin and different from the rest of the unit, but not nearly as bad as I was expecting from some of the lower reviews.  They look fine, they just sound a little rattly if you tap on them.  Biggest con for me was that the clearance between shelves was a bit shorter than I wanted. Some standard cleaning products will not fit the way I'd hoped. By the time I'd figured that out, I was done with assembly.  But I made it work.  Pros:  Very inexpensive, and despite some of the cons,  I knew I wasn't buying an heirloom quality piece of furniture at that low price, but it was far better than I expected for such an inexpensive piece. Looks decent enough for a laundry room.

So needless to say: easy to use, functional, space saving gadgets and kitchen equipment are very important to me.I used to have separate electric salt and pepper grinder's that were pretty fancy. The downside was that they were big (each one took up about as much space as a 20 oz bottle of soda) and heavy (6 AAA batteries and an electric motor will do that). And they didn't hold all that much before they needed to be refilled.Fortunately, Ozeri's Duo Ultra Salt and Pepper Mill and Grinder came to me at the perfect time after the motor on one of my grinders finally died and I needed a replacement. I have to say I love this thing. As the name suggests it holds salt and pepper, in separate chambers. You hold the base and turn the top in one direction for salt and the other for pepper. It comes with a removable base cap on the bottom for storage (so the area where the salt and pepper actually come out doesn't get gross). The base cap also doubles as a handy funnel when it's time to refill.

Does it really \"grill\" them? No, but it's not the fault of this particular pan. If you want real grilling, use a barbeque.  Obviously you don't get that smokey flavor from this. But if you want to cook a steak or some onions and peppers for a fajita and you can't or don't want to fire up the barbeque,  this will do a good job, searing the food where it touches it but not sauteing or frying it. It also uses a lot less energy than an oven, and takes less time.I've found two downsides of grill pans. First, since it's not designed to be used with much, if any, fat, some foods will stick. I've had some problems cooking fish; when it comes time to flip or remove a salmon fillet, you may find yourself scraping vigorously with a spatula to avoid leaving that nice crust behind, stuck to the pan, even though you've brushed the fish with oil first. This may change eventually, if the pan gets thoroughly seasoned from use. (Of course, the alternative is a non-stick version,  but no, thank you.)Second, be sure you have a hood fan that works well, or a very well ventilated kitchen,  or your house will likely fill with smoke. Putting a cover (or upside-down pot) over it may help.But these issues are inherent with grill pans. This particular model is well designed and well made and reasonably priced. It's solid without weighing a ton, and I've had no problem with warping or cracking.  It has a flat griddle on the other side, useful for pancakes or, for those who like them fried, burgers.

So far, the only downside reported by the ever-hungry boys around here is that it only makes one sandwich at a time. A quick workaround was discovered, however, when impatience won out in the fight for breakfast. They simply filled our four-slice toaster with their bread of choice and used the maker to cook two eggs at the same time, one on top, one on the bottom. The lower one will cook slightly faster, but no one here seemed to care when it meant faster eats. When using the sandwich maker as designed, our only recommendation is to take care with cheese, as it seems to make up 90% of any mess made. Cleanup is still pretty quick and easy, but why make it harder than it needs to be? We use a biscuit cutter to trim cheese slices. Because it is slightly smaller than the 4&#34; cooker rings, it helps keeps melting cheese from getting out of hand. We have tried all kinds of creative stuff with this thing and the more creative we get, the more we think of trying. Mostly, though, we use it as designed. It's just plain simple and it is nice to be able to do other things while breakfast is cooking.

Bodum is the foremost name in quality French press pots (styles include the Chambord, Brazil, Kenya, and Eileen), and the Chambord is the flagship line, available in 3, 4, 8, and 12 cups.*NOTE*: the \"cups\" listed on the box refers to the *European* 4-oz. espresso cup, not a 6- or 8-oz. U.S. cup, so the U.S. measurements are: 3 cup = 1.5 U.S. (12 oz.), 4 cup = 2 U.S. (16 oz.), 8 cup = 4 U.S. (32 oz.) and 12 cup = 6 U.S. (48 oz.).The Chambord press is simple, efficient, and stylish, and most importantly, solidly constructed. Made of a borosilicate beaker and chromed brass with a molded handle, with proper care, it will last for years. Parts are dishwasher safe, but I prefer to hand wash. There are a number of cheap, made-in-China imposters to be found in discount kitchen stores, but these do not compare to the Portuguese-made originals.Because the French press takes a coarser grind and doesn't use a paper filter, this allows the coffee's oils and essences to be extracted 100% for a full-bodied, intense brew reminiscent of espresso. Unflavoured dark roasts yield the best results.To make the perfect cup of French press coffee, use one Bodum scoop (2 Tbsp, included) per 4-oz. cup of coffee (coarse grind ONLY). Add hot, not boiling water, stir with a chopstick or plastic spoon, and put the lid on (with the filter pulled to the top in the closed position). Do not press down. Allow grounds to steep for four minutes. Leaving the spout in the closed position, grasp the handle firmly with the spout pointed away from you. Using the flat of your hand, push the handle down *slowly and evenly* (if you shove the handle down, there is a chance that scalding coffee may shoot out!) until the filter is at the bottom of the carafe. Pour and enjoy. Be sure to thoroughly clean the filter after each use.

My husband uses it most often, making French press coffee several time a day. He told me just yesterday that it is easy to pour out of and the water boils so much faster than in our previous tall narrow kettle that he often can't get the grounds ready before the water is ready. I recall that another reviewer said her 8 year old son can use it with ease to make himself cocoa, so we concur that it's easy to manage. The whistle lid is almost silent, however, so I'd say if that's really important to you, don't count on the whistle. For us, it boils water so quickly that we don't have to rely on the whistle.

It'll simplify things.Setup was a pain in the butt.  If you don't have a smart phone or a wireless laptop, you cant configure the device.  Both methods require going to a site on the phone/laptop, running some software, changing your wireless access point from your regular one to the scale, configuring the scale, then switching back to your regular access point.  Clearly a product designed by 20-somethings that grew up with facebook and smart phones, and are comfortable with jiggling wifi settings.  NOT a high touch install and setup.For whatever reason, our one wireless laptop would connect to but not allow configuration.  I never tried to figure out why, just used the smart phone.  This induces a situation where the phone wants to look for the scale to configure it, and the scale must be in setup mode, but the phone process was cumbersome enough that the scale would sometimes time out of setup mode before I got to the part of the setup where the phone would look for it.  Then you have to remove a battery, wait ten seconds, go back to the phone and restart the setup and try to get it done before it times out again.It was completely non obvious to me how to add other users.  But in reading the manual you set up the primary person, and then they go to their devices on the fitbit dashboard and from there they can invite up to 7 more people by sending them an email.  When they click on 'accept' in the email they're added to the scales users.  I didnt go far enough to determine how you would tell it specifically who was who if you had a lot of people on it.  It can tell the difference between people if there is a large weight discrepancy, say my wife being 120lbs and I'm 180.  So it knows which of us is which when we step on.  But if we had a teenager that was close to my wifes weight, you'd have to have a way to tell it.  Whatever that is!Only other thing I noted from removing and replacing the batteries 57 times is that the springs that hold the battery at each end seem like they aren't the strongest or best made.  Hopefully it wont require battery changes that often.Once set up, it worked fine.  The scale takes your weight and then extrapolates the fat % and BMI based on your sex, height, weight and so forth.  There is a 'lean' or 'athletic' option because this type of calculation doesnt work for people with low body fat content.  Each time you step on the scale it weighs and calculates the bmi and fat % and uploads it immediately to your fitbit dashboard.  The integration is nice, as I can weigh myself repeatedly throughout the day and have it pop up automatically.I noted that like the fitbit ultra, the dashboard doesn't report the battery status of the unit correctly.  The laptop said the scale was down to 1/4 battery but they were brand new, and my other computer says it has nearly a full charge.So a large amount of improvement on the setup polishing (this would have been a lot easier with a usb port on it and some software) and I expect they'll have some frustrated returns of the product until that area becomes push button simple.  Also looks like there needs to be a little more polishing around the user interface on the computer end as well, but I've already found a number of bugs in the fitbit web site.  Hopefully they'll get there.My limited experience with fitbit support wasn't pleasing.  They're only open m-f during extended business hours, they do not do phone or chat, and they take a day or two to respond to an email.  Mine specifically noted that my fitbit ultra wasn't working at all and that I'd tried upgrading the firmware and resetting it, but it was dead.  Two days later I got the most unhelpful suggestion to upgrade the firmware, which I'd already said I'd tried.  So instead of trying to process a return with this 24-48 hour turnaround email support, I just returned the fitbit to amazon and got a replacement from them.Very cool technology.  We have two ultras and the aria.  I've lost 60lbs so far, but most of it without these tools.  With them I have much better recording of my efforts and intakes and with most of it being automatic, its a huge facilitator in the effort to work out, lose weight and feel better.  Its just that my immediate reliability and ease of installing the fitbit products aren't quite where they need to be.Lastly, I sure would appreciate it if fitbit would package their products more simply and reduce the price a bit.  The packaging is lovely, very well done and quite high end.  But since I'm a retired marketing guy, I know its expensive to package this way.Edit: The scale has been working fine for us, but I think I found another problem.  I liked weighing myself 3-4 times a day with my old scale, just to see how different things affected my weight like hydration, workouts, etc.  But I'm hesitant to step on this scale aside from my first thing morning weigh-in because its going to transmit that data to the fitbit web site.  I'll have to look but I didnt see anything about a 'weigh only and dont report' option.The other annoying thing is that I started this odyssey at 247 and I'm at 189 now, but the fitbit web site says I've only lost 51.5 pounds.  I actually didnt catch that, but my 7 year old was looking over my shoulder and commented that the math was wrong. I did have some problems with the fitbit web site taking weight input for dates in the future when I typed in the wrong info.  No limit checking apparently.  So there were some 'future weights' that kept messing up my charts.  Maybe thats still a problem.These products really have enormous potential and I've used them extensively in the short time I've had them...but the setup and the web site polish needs a lot of work.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2012", "summary": "The setup needed more work before releasing this"}

A few vices really undercut its virtues. I think the flaws should be mentioned first because they are potential deal breakers.The outside surface is smooth metal, the shape is basically an inverted pear making it top heavy, there is no rubber on the base and the base is narrower than any other cup of this type that I have tried. All of this amounts to an unstable design prone to tipping over and not securely seating in a cup holder. Every time I use this I have to tape something to the base bulking it up and countering the smooth metal surface so it fits snugly in a cup holder.Also, the parts to the lid which are designed to make it leak proof require disassembling to clean. If you are not very very careful reassembling the pieces it will leak. The key is to have the lid in the \"closed\" position so the gasket/seal does not shift when attaching the lid to the base. Other people have mentioned a need to release the pressure so I initially screwed the lid on in the open position then closed it once it was tight. This allows the gasket potential room to to move resulting in a compromised seal. In the closed position there is a disk that holds the gasket in place thus preventing it from moving if it hits one of the sides of the base.Other people have mentioned the paint eventually chipping or peeling. I just received this but it appears to be painted very well, almost like auto paint. I have doubts this will develop the problems that some people have experienced. At this stage I'd say Thermos has addressed the chipping/peeling problem.The coffee does stay hot for as long as it takes to finish every drop, generally several hours. That is something I appreciate.Overall, the proclivity towards tipping over and even falling out of a cup holder due to the slick surface and top heavy design outweighs its ability to keep coffee hot for an extended period.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2012", "summary": "Sorry to say the bad outweighs the good"}

Both pillows are fantastic.  But I'll tell you this, don't bother with low loft.  The high-lot pillows are only about as tall as the length of your hand, and they compress a lot from there.  In fact, the soft high-loft pillow compress to about 1\" when you lay on it, which is great for stomach sleepers.  But given the compression, low loft is completely unnecessary.The soft pillow will give you a true floating in clouds feeling which is hard to describe yet extremely comfortable.  The firm pillow still has that effect, with less sinking in.But to be honest, I could quite easily mistake one for the other.  I tend to like softer pillows but have found the firm pillow to still be very soft and comfortable.My only caution is that side sleepers will likely not like the soft pillow.  It just compresses too much.  Go for the firmer pillow.  In fact, if you aren't sure or like to sleep in different positions, go for the firm pillow.There is a rubber like smell for the first couple of days (I didn't leave them outside to air out, the stench didn't bother me that much).

The serrated peeler took off a very thin layer of the skin very, very easily.  It's that sharp.  But unlike my older, straight-edge peeler, it seemed to slip every few minutes and collide with my index and third fingers, which I was using to hold onto the stalks, much too easily. This happened a few times and I was left with several nasty abrasive cuts.  I tried the peeler again later to make thin strips of a hard cheese.  Again, it was difficult to control without slipping.

Yet I still search the shelves, bins, and brackets of retail stores, and tirelessly peruse internet sites in the hope of finding that one special spatula to someday replace my \"vintage pieces\" should fate intervene.This STAINLESS STEEL AMCO FISH TURNER, my friends is NOT THE ONE.  This spatula IS perfectly sized but extremely lightweight, resulting in a slightly awkward feel in the hand.  I find the slanted angle of the working end also a bit cumbersome, despite my having been raised using a similarly angled spatula.  Additionally, the end is not as \"sharp\" as it could be, meaning I have a somewhat difficult time separating foods (i.e. pancakes, fried eggs) with it.  Another caveat is that foods tend to stick to the working end of this utensil, requiring soaking and scrubbing both before and sometimes after manual and machine wash cycles.  (The finish is a matte finish; very dull which likely plays a distinct role in adherence of food.)To reiterate, I \"like\" this spatula, but just don't \"love it\".  The concept is there but needs \"fine tuning\".  I will still use it, but it is not my \"go to\" utensil nor will it supersede any of my vintage pieces.SUGGESTION TO MANUFACTURER:  Increase the weight of the handle just a tad more to make it more substantial.  \"Sharpen\" the edge of the tool and slightly decrease the angle of the working end.

On busy mornings you can't beat the convenience of the automatic drip, but when you have a friend over for coffee, or are having a festive weekend breakfast, the French press ritual is charming, and the flavor is coffee perfection! I've had many French press pots over the years, from the standard Bodum, to the solid Francois et Mimi, to a Sterling Pro to the Kona French Press. Since a French press pot is essentially low tech, what I've found is that the quality of the coffee produced is as dependent on the user as it is on the pot, although I've produced the most awful sludge from the most expensive of pots--and that's how I know!The criteria I use to evaluate a pot are as follows:Is it intuitive and easy to use?Is it easy to disassemble to clean?Does the screen filter out grounds sufficiently?Is the pot sturdy and attractive?Could a novice produce a fine pot of coffee?Does the pot keep the coffee hot for a reasonable amount of time?The Kona French Press performs well in every area.  Although it's advertised as three pieces, you don't disassemble the lid.  The pot is actually two pieces.  It's very easy to use.  I grind a third of a cup of beans to a count of twelve, dump the grounds in the pot and boil water.  I pour a little boiling water in the pot and stir with a wooden spoon, then add water to the top band, replace the top, and set the kitchen timer for five minutes.  The directions on the box call for four minutes and using a tablespoon (helpfully provided) per six ounce cup.  A four miinute brew is not sstrong enough for my taste, and all my coffee cups are huge, so I'll use the measurer for something else.  A third of a cup of beans is perfect for this size pot., IMO.When the timer ding, slowly press the screen to the bottom of the pot, make sure the lid is positioned correctly to pour, and enjoy two very large cups of perfect coffee. There's a little sludge left in the bottom of the cup, but the screen performs brilliantly to filter out the grounds.  There's also a strainer on the lid in case any large bits get by.The Kona is very easy to clean.  Not finding any instructions to the contrary, I've been sticking it in the dishwasher, and it's come through with flying colors. I've never had another French press pot I could do that with.  YAY!!  The glass is thick, and well protected by the black bands around the pot.  I'm careful to bloom the coffee with a wooden spoon, but I also don't worry about the pot getting sideswiped by a skillet in the sink.  It's solid.The Kona is also attractive.  It's a bit sculptural and I like the black accents.  I keep it on the kitchen counter, and it looks very European and businesslike.  This pot would be the perfect wedding gift or present for someone you'd like to introduce to great coffee.

In fact, because I drink so much tea my dental hygienist has told me on several occasions that I should be drinking it through a straw. (Doing so helps cut down on staining of the teeth.) But I've always found sticking a straw in a flimsy plastic water bottle kind of awkward. Now that's no longer an issue!This BPA-free tumbler is very well made.

Well, I did. It really is a quiet machine (compared to my Hamilton Beach blade grinder). It produces a very consistent grind.I have only one con in regards to this machine:There's a flexible plastic cap that swivels over the hole in the lid for sealing the grinds into the container. Two comments about this: a) if you're paying this much money for a grinder, you're probably not grinding your coffee only to store it for a few days--you might as well buy pre-ground coffee at that point and save yourself some money; b) It gets in the way of putting the grinds container into the machine so that grounds fall freely into the container. And pushing in the container far enough can sometimes make it difficult to then get it out.All in all, I love the machine.

I purchased them for my cottage because the stove uses propane and the regular Calphalon from my main home were burning the food (even on low), plus the propane was leaving a residue that was difficult to scrub off.I took those back to my house and bought this non-stick set for the cottage.  They are very attractive and I really like the glass covers. I've cooked with them over the past several weekends and find that they cook very evenly.  The handles stay cool and the propane residue washes right off.  With the propane it's hard to regulate the heat, so I wouldn't stay that nothing sticks, but they do clean up easily.  They hang beautifully on the hooks above the windows also.With Calphalon you never want to put them in the dishwasher and that may be the source of some of the poor reviews I've seen.

At first I was a bit skeptical about the claims of weight loss, but wanted to believe them.  Now I do.I only use it once a day, to replace my usual Ramen soup with potato chips lunch.  Here's what is happening...my big fat stomach, which quite honestly was the first part of me to hit any wall I walked into is shrinking.  My rings are getting a little large, AND, most amazing, IMO, is that the swelling in my knuckles has subsided by at least 75%.Favorite lunch is tomato soup with a whole bunch of vegies added:  Kale, cabbage, celery, tomato, onion, carrot, beet, maybe a bit of red bell pepper, and some raw chia seeds.  Depending on the proportions of each, it can taste a bit different from one day to the next.I've also ground up vegies and added them to spaghetti sauce.Apple, raw cranberries, frozen strawberries, and frozen raspberries make a tasty fruit smoothie.I've used the milling blade to grind up cashews and almonds.  Does a great job!Only experienced one leaking episode, and that was my fault when I didn't tighten the blade part enough.One issue I've seen others speak of, and which happened a few times to me was having the inner (rubber?  silicone?) seal loosen.  Well, it hasn't happened since I figured out that maybe it was because it, and the lip of the plastic grinding cup, were dry, which would cause enough friction to loosen the seal.  So now before grinding, I run a damp finger around the top rim of the grinding cup and then attach the blade part.  No more problems with the seal coming out.Hubby's doctor told him he needed to eat more vegetables.  This is the perfect way to get them, especially for older people who may have chewing issues.  Raw vegies are great, but let's face it...when you have dentures, it's not easy to chew them, and cooking them to the point where they're chewable often turns them into a disgusting, tasteless, discolored mush.Anyway, like others have said, cleanup is a breeze.

Many of our previous measuring sets have this handy feature that helps prevent using more measuring cups (and therefore cleaning more cups) than necessary.2. The brushed stainless steel finish is just rough enough that flour will leave a thin film of dust on it and sugar will also partially coat the inside even though it is thoroughly cleaned and dried. This isn't enough that it is messing up the measurement, but it just bugs us because our other cups don't do this.Conclusion:Not a bad set of cups. If the issues above don't bother you, they are great.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2013", "summary": "Really great w/2 small issues"}

I used basic models with unsealed lids, and high end Japanese brands with fuzzy logic.  I gave this product 4 star for the unbeatable price and performance.The cheaper basic models without sealed lids are pretty good too, for cooking rice.  To prevent messy steam, the trick is to use an oversize cooker.  If you only use half of the capacity, you shouldn't need to clean up the table after cooking.  A non-stick coating saves you time cleaning and saves rice.  The rice is usually on the soft and moist side of things, but that's most people prefer anyway.  It's harder to do drier and crispier rice.This model is almost perfect for cooking white rice.  For the price I don't suppose you eat premium rice everyday from true Asian specialty shops, right?  There's little difference for this model and high end models if your rice isn't that premium.This cooker is primarily designed to prepare rice the way the Asians eat, particularly the Japanese and Chinese.  This is not to make microwave multi-grain paste.  You have to make the engineers and designers willing to eat your paste so they can understand how to cook it.  No amount of high end fuzzy logic can make your paste the way you like it all by itself if the engineers haven't thought of it.For cooking white rice, this one is as good as any, unless you have exquisite taste in premium rice.  For steaming vegetable and other things, it's quite handy steaming alone or cooking rice at the same time.  When steaming alone, it stops automatically when the water is all gone.Everything is best eaten fresh.  And with a delay timer, there's no reason to keep the rice in warm mode for long after cooking.  The warm mode tend to dry out the rice a bit for long periods.There's a bit of inconsistency in the manual.  The steam vent of my model can only be pulled out from the outside, not from the inside.  Lucky that I didn't damage the lid.  You actually do not need to disconnect the electric cord when in the off state.  But I'm sure it's not recommended for legal liability reasons, and to save some energy.  In my opinion it's as safe as not unplugging the TV after watching.  Also there's a flat little plastic cup below the lid hinge, for collecting condensed water from the lid, which the manual didn't mention.  The little ring at the opposite side of the plastic cup is the temporary holder for the rice spatula.For higher end models there is an extra electric plug at the bottom of the cookers, secured in position by magnetic force.  Unplugging and plugging are as easy as pushing a button.For more expensive models, basically there are two lids.  The inner lid is easily detachable for you to rinse it in water together with the inner pot.  The outer lid, fixed to the cooker, hardly ever needs cleaning or attention.  For this model, even though the lid is directly exposed to the steam, the lid looked clean after cooking.  I doubt very much if you need to clean it every time if you only cook rice in the normal way.  If you steam vegetable or just put the steam tray in, you shouldn't be cleaning the lid at all.With the single lid design, the steam condensed to water at the lid and soft plastic seal.  When you open the lid, some of the condensed water will drain through the little plastic cup below the lid hinge.  A small amount of water will be collected at the seals.  It's not likely to happen, but if you close the lid again a few drop of water may drip down to the cooking surface, when you have taken the inner pot out.  But then a few drops probably will not hurt the cooking surface or the inner pot.I do not like that it beeps too loud, too high pitch, louder than my microwave.  I do not like the - - sign shown when the delay timer is not in use.  It's also too brightly red when in the off state.  I prefer a green or yellow little dot, not too bright in the dark but easy to spot in day light.As with all rice cookers, if you put it under anything, the wood above will be damaged because of the steam.  I attach a thin plate of clear acrylic at the bottom of the wooden cabinet to protect it.  Or you can just pull it out in the open while cooking, and push it back after.If you are careful, the non-stick surface should last enough for your $40.  I don't know about the plastic seal though.  My experience with over the top kettles is that the seal is the first thing to go.  But they sell replacement parts and the cost of the seal is still a small fraction of the kettle.The cooker is on the slow side, taking about 30 min to cook.  Higher end cookers don't cook a lot faster because you cannot boil away the water too fast.  Big simple unsealed cookers can cook some 10 or more minutes faster.  But the quality of the cook rice cannot be compared.  I'm sure microwave can cook a lot faster.Update: 2011/8Everything works like new, even better.  I don't wipe clean the lid every use, because it won't get dirty and messy that much.  I don't empty the cup to hold condensed water, because it normally will not overflow for my normal volume of rice.  I don't dry the inner pot completely before starting cooking because it's pretty tough.The plastic seal at the rim is still in perfect condition.  The inner pot did not have any dent on it.  The all important non-stick surface is still intact.  Nothing came off or scratched.  Looks the same as other higher priced models that I used.  There are minor signs of wear and tear at the rim but expected.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2010", "summary": "Decent cooker for the Japanese/Chinese way to prepare rice"}

I think the Pro works a little bit better at the dirt extraction and smells a little less \"chemically\", but this is still a great formula. It also costs a little bit less for an extra 12 ounces, so if you are going for economy, this product is still a great solution to use. I would choose the Pro over this if I had to, but wouldn't ever turn this stuff down.The Febreeze scent is not overwhelming, but rather a delicate touch to the solution. As I stated earlier, this solution has a little bit more of a chemical smell than the Pro verison, but it is still far less intense than some of the other solutions I have tried.In terms of cleaning, this did not protect as well as the Pro for future stains, but it did still offer some added protection for future messes. I was impressed with just HOW clean the carpet came, and more importantly, that it took less solution and pass-overs to truly clean the carpet. With cheaper solutions I use two tanks to truly clean the carpet, but with this solution and the Pro, I only needed one.I think there is an even match between this and the Pro when you weigh their effectiveness with the amount/price ratio.

On first look, theNesco American Harvest JB-50 2-in-1 Juicer/Blender, White with Green Trimis attractive but doesn't appear to be made from top notch materials, except, perhaps for the nice, heavy glass pitcher. The plastics of the juicer are fine, so I have no big problem with them. However, the plastic, green latches that hold the juicer and blender onto the base are very cheap looking and feeling. I can only hope they're made out of some space-age technology and they're more durable than they seem.While the blender looks great, unfortunately with only two speeds and pulse, it doesn't work very well at all. I even tried one of the recipes included in the instruction booklet and was left with a chunky drink that needed to be more pulverized. In my application, the blender could only be used with softer foods and liquids, and though it says it can crush ice, I seriously doubt it'd do a good job. The juicer ended up working better, with a decent amount of juice, and left less excess waste than I thought it would. Although the pulp ends up more around the filter sieve than in the bin. One other bad thing is the shoot is pretty small, so fruits and veggies have to be cut smaller than other juicers, which means more preparation. There is some good: suction cups that keep the machine from moving around while in use and the latches must be locked for the product to work, so mishaps aren't likely to happen. Switching out from the blender to the juicer and vice versa is a smooth operation and takes no time at all. The recipes are actually quite good and I will try others out eventually. I didn't find it too hard to clean, but it would have been nice had they included a cleaning brush for the filter sieve.This isn't tops in either juicing or blending departments, but it might be a decent starter for those who haven't juiced before or casual users who would like both appliances in one product.

I own 3 dogs who occasionally have `accidents' inside, a pre-teen daughter prone to spills, and a husband who thinks the house is self-cleaning.  Berber carpets in the living, hall and dining areas, as well as a home gym.  The bedrooms have an older shag carpet.  I've never used a machine spot cleaner before, and love the idea of a machine that gives you two cleaners for the price of one.Enter Bissell's Lift-Off Deep Cleaner...The Machine:It's a heavy one - 30+ pounds. Moves remarkably well though, despite its heft. The Lift-Off portable section is about 15 pounds by itself.  The directions are somewhat sparse but by looking at the labeled diagrams and reading the short `how to's' you can figure it out.No diagram for the Lift-Off specifically is in either guide and the directions for portable spot cleaning mode are somewhat poor.  I could get the Lift-Off portion off, but found reseating it to be a bit of a struggle, with the directions offering no help.  Eventually I ended up at the Bissell site watching videos for guidance.  That did help, and I'd recommend checking it out prior to using this Bissell product.A Quick Start Guide and a Bissell User's Guide are included in the package, along with the deep cleaner and a starter 8 ounce bottle of Bissell's 2x Professional Deep Cleaning Formula.The portable Lift-Off is where the dirty water container and the water/solution tank is housed.  It sits on top of the rolling base with the brushes. A foot pedal on the left (as you face the machine) releases the Lift-Off for use. The cord containment is wrapped around the Lift-Off portion, and the hose for the Lift-Off is wrapped around the opposite side of the Lift-Off from the cord.  The place where you attach one of two attachments to the Lift-Off hose is upright towards the right back (facing machine) of the Bissell.  Overall, it is a very efficient design.The on/off switch is on the Lift-Off and operates the entire Bissell Deep Cleaner. You need to depress it and let the machine sit running for one minute prior to using it after you add the water/solution tank when it's filled and ready to go.  NOTE: The Bissell is noisy - sort of like a small jet engine, so you may want to wear ear protection if using this machine for a long time.The `trigger' is on the handle.  You have to install the handle prior to using the Bissell.  This takes 4 Phillips head screws (included) and a long-handled Phillips head screwdriver (not included).  Patience is key when doing this one.  The screw holes are not visible, but the holes are marked with arrows on the black plastic handle. You have to feel your way until the screws seat and start to work their way in.  A mildly frustrating endeavor, but it worked eventually and the handle is securely fastened to the unit once these screws are in place.The Bissell Formula:Bissell recommends you use only their formulas in this machine. The current Bissell formulas are 2x's as concentrated as before - leaving you to believe you'd need less to do the same job. Honestly, I'm not sure if that's the case, but the formulas are 2x's the price of non-concentrated formulas!I managed to find a 64 ounce bottle for the 50 ounce price at my local store.  I had planned on buying the solution from Amazon with the buy 3 get one free (4 for 3) promotion, but even with that promotion, it was cheaper to buy it locally. So check solution prices before you buy. I also got a Bissell Pretreat spray for over 50% less than it was on Amazon - at a local store.Several Bissell formula choices are available:Bissell 2X Professional Deep Cleaning Formula, 48 ounces, 78H63,Bissell 2X Fiber Cleansing Advanced Formula, 24 Ounces, 62E5,Bissell 2X Pet Stain and Odor Advanced Formula, 24 Ounces, 99K5,Bissell 2X Multi-Allergen Advanced Formula, 24 Ounces, 89Q5,Bissell 2X Natural Orange Extract Advanced Formula, 24 Ounces, 83P3, andBissell 2X Lavender Essence Advanced Formula, 24 Ounces, 34B5.  I suggest if you plan on cleaning a larger than 500 sq' area, you pick up more solution than the starter 8 ounce that came with the Bissell Lift-Off Deep Cleaner.The Bissell 2x Professional Deep Cleaning Formula smells very fresh.  Strong while cleaning your carpets, but that softens as the carpets dry.  By the time it dried completely, it was barely there for me, but a faint clean scent remained.  If you are highly sensitive to scents, you may want to avoid it though, and try the Allergen formula.Warning: regarding Professional Deep Cleaning Formula strength -  if you don't want your hands to get chaffed, don't let your skin touch the solution or solution/water mixture.  I'd suggest wearing rubber gloves while emptying and filling tanks - I didn't and my hands paid the price.Carpet Deep Cleaning:I chose to test drive this model in our home gym. Daily use in this room,  but not heavy traffic. I vacuumed well with aDyson DC28 Animalvacuum first.  Some spots and high traffic areas were visible on the carpet, and were sprayed withBissell Tough Stain PreCleaner, 22 ounces, 40015 minutes prior to deep cleaning.To begin you  use 2 ounces (1/4 cup) per tank full of Bissell Formula solution (your choice) into hot tap water to the line on the water/solution tank.  I suggest using a funnel  not included) for this task, and  putting the water in first, as if you put the solution first you will get a lot of foam. Swirl to mix. Place tank into spot on machine. Turn on the machine to pre-heat for one minute prior to deep cleaning or spot cleaning.Solution will be dispensed quickly if you follow the directions of pulling the trigger and holding it  as you move the Bissell forward and back, and then releasing the trigger and going back and forth to extract the solution.Some carpets may only need you to hold the trigger down going one way, as on the Berber it was easy to see the carpet got a good dose of water and solution  the first time - this would have saved on solution and multiple tank refills too.  Bottom line: this thing really sucks down the juice so be prepared to fill the water/solution tanks many times for a large area!For approximately every two water/solution refills, you need to empty the dirty water tank. At least that was the case for me. There is an audible change that indicates the unit is sucking air - the dirty water tank may or may not be to the `full' line (mine wasn't there yet), but it's full and time to dump the dirty water.  Grit may also be visible on the red filter as you lift off the tank, and you would want to wipe it off as it affects suction and performance of the machine.Grit and carpet fibers tended to collect on the bottom of the machine behind the rollers as it cleaned - even after a thorough Dyson vacuuming.  I took this to mean that the `deep cleaning' was doing its job and pulling out the deeply embedded gunk.Deep Cleaning Results:Almost immediately the room you're cleaning smells better.  Amazing how much odors are picked up in carpets even with daily vacuumingMost pre-treated spots (dog vomit - old stains) seemed to disappear after cleaning the spot 2x's with 5-6 slow passes over the stain in several directions.  Larger traffic areas that were pre-treated and received the same treatment still showed a slight discoloration, but were much lighter right after cleaning.  The water was black with dirt, so I wasn't surprised.As the spots dried, they were lighter, but still visible. Bissell suggests on their website that if this occurs, you use the Pretreat spray again and let it sit overnight before trying the Lift-Off spot cleaner.  I will update my review after trying that one, but for now suffice to say that older spots may or may not come off the carpet, even with a pretreatment. You should see a positive difference if not elimination of new spots however.Spot Cleaning with Lift-Off:I tried the Lift-Off spot cleaner on heavily stained spots on Berber inside my home, inside my car, and on my couch's upholstery.  I must say I was more impressed with this part of the unit, than the deep cleaner.Carpet spots in house: These were all dog vomit (mainly bile, some with blood - old Lab is sweet, but at 12 she's got a fussy tummy) spots, which have previously been cleaned with both OxyClean and Spot Shot.  Neither worked well.Carpet and Upholstery in car: coffee spills, chocolate stains, general dirt. About 8 years worth of general grime.Couch Upholstery: general dirt and home odors - no visible spots or stains.I pre-treated all spots on the carpets for 20 hours with Bissell's Pet Stain and Odor pre-treater (found locally, but not on Amazon). Vacuumed the area to be cleaned and then mixed the Bissell Professional Deep Cleaning Formula with hot water.  I pre-heated the machine for 1 minute and then spot cleaned three spots on the carpet.Because the brush on the attachment head seemed a bit wimpy for the stains (it's good, but these are 'ugh' stains...), I used a cleaning brush I have at home to scrub the area after putting the water/solution mix on to the area, then extracted the water via the Bissell portable. The power of extraction was GREAT - you have to tip the head of the attachment down, but it's easy to get the feel for it.  Several passes in several directions left the area dry in 3 hours.One tip while using the Lift-Off - tilt the head down and over the area to be cleaned and hover about 2\" over the area as you pull the trigger to dispense the solution.  This covers a pretty wide path, and then you simply release the trigger, drag the attachment head securely over the stain to extract it. You do have to apply medium pressure to the head of the attachment and angle the head to get the maximum extraction of water and solution.The stains in the carpet?  Well, they are still there, but like the stains in the gym that were cleaned with the upright - they are more faint.  A huge improvement and I would have to credit the pretreatment, the Bissell Professional solution and the pull of the portable for this result. I intend to be more vigilant about immediate accident clean-ups now that I have this portable unit, and would imagine that if found in quickly and pre-treated with Bissell's Pet products, new stains will be eliminated.The car upholstery and carpet looked great.  Brightened up my light gray interior on my 4Runner and smells nice too. Very quick and easy to use in the car. No more worries about muddy feet mucking up the carpet!The hands-down winner in the portable testing was the couch.  I didn't think it was really dirty, but it had a cooking and pets smell to it.  That's completely gone and the navy blue fabric with threads of lighter colors, is now brighter and fresh looking. The muddy gunk I got out of it was amazing, and the Bissell was so easy to use, I'm actually looking forward to using it on all my furniture before and after the holidays.Overall Rating for the Bissell Lift-Off Deep Cleaner: 4 out of 5The deep cleaned carpet looked fresher, brighter and smelled great.  I think it did `deep clean' by comparison to the Hoover branded home cleaner and the Rug Doctor machines which just swirled things around on the top of the carpet and left a lot more water behind, for longer drying times.The heat, the  Bissell solution and great water extraction from Berber carpets, all left behind a good result.  As good as a professional cleaning?  No, but better than most home cleaning units and rentals I've tried, and you have the convenience of two machines for a lot of different jobs, and it all works well.Really loved the Lift-Off portable though.  It's a 5 out of 5 in my opinion and a surprise. I will use it a lot and because it doesn't suck down the solution and water quickly at all, it will save me a ton money in spray-on carpet and upholstery cleaners that never worked well anyway.If this Bissell had been able to eliminate old stains on my carpets, had better directions and a bigger water/solution tank - it would have been a 5 star machine overall.  Can any machine do that?  I'm not sure, but I'll continue to look for it!The Bissell Lift-Off Deep Cleaner is a great home unit for people with new carpets and furniture that they want to keep clean with semi-annual cleansing and spot clean-ups.For those of us with older homes, less time for carpet cleaning, messy families, pets and old stains, it's good, but not great in terms of a carpet cleaner. A solid, quality product with much to offer, it's  not a magic elixir to what is ailing your old carpets. While I had high hopes that stains would disappear with just a bit of extra effort - as seen in the Bissell promo video, I've not found that to be true.As for upholstery and fast clean ups of new messes, and cleaning your car...the portable Lift-Off cleaner is fantastic. A bit heavy, but you don't have to hold it while it does its job.Suggestions for Bissell:1. Bigger Water/Solution Tank: the small tank of water/solution mix is quickly depleted while deep cleaning. I could only get a strip of carpet about 4'x6' completed and then I'd have to refill the tank.  That seemed far too frequently to be running to the sink, but probably not all that unusual for most home cleaning units.2. Incorporate Videos:  include a DVD of the helpful videos from the Bissell website, or improve the Lift-Off Deep Cleaner User's Guide.3. Easier Handle Attachment: figure out how to have the handle attached before it ships to the consumer.  A tricky assembly, even with only 4 screws.Is it worth the price?  That depends upon the consumer.  If you want an awesome spot cleaner and a good deep cleaner - for sure it's a deal.  Particularly if you have a newer home with kids and pets.If you only really see yourself using a deep cleaner, you may want to consider other Bissell Deep Cleaners which also have heat, but are less expensive. Like this one:Bissell ProHeat Upright Deep Cleaner, 25A3.Take a look at the photos I've posted to see product photos, and before and after shots of carpet deep cleaning.UPDATE: 10/8/13Still using this cleaner and loving it!

I've purchased two other lid organizers that were more trouble than they were worth. This one has literally transformed my most dreaded to use cabinet into a spacious one used with ease as it was intended to be.This installs firmly and is not too deep of a fit (as others like it are where they extend over 6&#34; into the cabinet when closed.) Mind you, we have to keep an inch or two in front of it clear so the door can close all the way, but not very much. If I had a really large cabinet, it could easily install on a side wall too. My husband had to change out the screws for shorter ones so they wouldn't go through the door of our cabinet, but that is a cabinet design. They'd have to ship this lid rack with at least 3-4 varying lengths of screws to cover all possible cabinet walls and doors. We don't find it a problem finding different screws as most things we buy require that any way.Six lids from small to very large fit in this. My lids are stainless steel and I have on glass dome lid. I do have to push down rather firmly for the lid handle to snap into it's proper position for one style of lid I have. For my other pan style (with a 1/2&#34; inner rim that extends deeper past the edge of the lid) I have to adjust the angle to get it past the curves and seated right, but then it's unmovable until I want it to be. Almost every lid of mine fits in one of these slots and most fit in at least two of them, some three. The only lid that doesn't fit is my large, every day skillet's glass lid. It's handle is the wide, upside-down, oblong U (see next paragraph on tips for these kinds of lids.) I have one just like it for my stockpot that is smaller and if fits in the lowest slot just fine with my tip below.TIP FOR LIDS WITH THESE CABINET-TYPE HANDLES: I found with my one stockpot lid that if I try to set it in the slot with the handle vertical, it leans too far forward and is not stable. When I turn it so the handle is horizontal and then slide the lid a bit to the right or left so that it sits with one side of the handle down in the handle groove, it has a snug fit all the way down and does not lean forward. With this kind of lid, there will only be one slot with a perfect fit for each lid (which is o.k. if you have a complete set from small to large.)It's made of a very sturdy, thick steel. While it states chrome and not stainless steel, I don't see the difference between my more expensive stainless steel items. Not all chrome is equal and there is a higher quality out there with better performance. I believe that is the quality this has been made with. With it's special scratch-resistant coating, I'm hoping it lasts a very long time.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2013", "summary": "Wonderful addition to my pan cabinet."}

Dehydrated sweet potatoes are one of the few foods he is not allergic to, but they retail for about $15.00 per pound. After doing the math it was easy to justify the purchase of this unit. Purchasing one bag a week of the dehydrated potatoes works out to about $780.00 per year. Purchasing this unit for $50.00 and buying 52 pounds of raw sweet potatoes only costs a total of about $76.00 for the year--plus the effort and the cost of electricity.So I purchased the unit and the sweet potatoes, sliced and blanched the potatoes as described, and cooked them for about six hours. They came out chewy and a little moist, so I put them in plastic bags in the freezer to draw out the rest of the moisture. Next time I'll increase the heat a bit, and the time after that I'll just lengthen the time. Obviously this is just cooking in its basic form so trial and error is a basic part of it. I'll also cut the potatoes lengthwise next time and a little thicker than specified in the instructions.UPDATE: June 8, 2013Now we're cooking!  Bought two more trays and figured out the time and heat combination that works best.

Some may even find it a bit over-engineered. It offers many options like built-in accessories (brush nozzel), the dust sensor section and even the 3 primary vaccum heads for use on various surfaces. I feel that Samsung could have refined and simplified the MotionSync a little, dropped the price a bit, and had a better final product for it. A single head that can handle and adjust to both flat surfaces and carpet like certain Dyson models stands out as a good example. For a corded vacuum, it has great reach and is fairly versatile. The innovative swivel base handles well and the large capacity canister is easy to remove and empty. It has such good suction, we're using it in our garage right now in place of our old shop-vac. It doesn't have quite that level of suction, but it is sure a heck of a lot quieter!My abode is home to a number of vacuums and steam cleaners, and the two other recent acquisitions that I'm comparing this Samsung model to are theHoover Air Cordless Series 3.0 Bagless Uprightand theDyson DC59 Animal Cordless. They are both coordless, so have a lot more range and are easier to use since you don't have to worry about being connected to a power outlet. They both run out of juice eventually though, so the MotionSync is your model if you need to use your vacuum for long periods of time. The 3 different heads are made for different surfaces, and the snaking suction tube lets you reach areas that standard uprights won't be able to manage. I like the dust sensor attachment, but don't really feel it is something that you have to have. It also requires extra batteries.Overall, this is an excellent cutting-edge-technology vacuum. If you don't need all of its bells and whistles, want to save some money, and prefer to have a (limitied battery life) cordless that nearly matches the MotionSync's capabilities, then I would recommend Hoover's Air Cordless Series 3.0 over the Samsung.

{"reviewerID": "ABYRKVQFIRZWM", "asin": "B000PY1IQ6", "reviewerName": "David Rubenstein", "helpful": [22, 23], "unixReviewTime": 1361145600, "reviewText": "(This review is posted for both the Aprilaire 600M and 600A units in order to contrast them and to describe their similar functions.)The Aprilaire folks say the &#8220;important considerations in the evaluation of a humidifier are precise control, sufficient capacity, trouble-free performance and minimum maintenance.&#8221; I would add cost, ease of operation, and ease of installation.  My sense is that this unit gets high marks in all of these areas.The Aprilaire 600 humidifier operates in conjunction with your heating system to add moisture to your air. It is called a bypass humidifier because some air leaving your furnace is rerouted to bypass your ventilation system and instead run through the humidifier, absorbing moisture through evaporation, before returning to your furnace and on into your home. (The bypass is accomplished as a function of the higher air pressure in the supply leaving your furnace than in the return air going into your furnace.)Generally, a hole is cut into your supply plenum (through which heated air leaves your furnace and goes into your home) and a bypass duct is run into the humidifier, which is mounted on the return plenum (which feeds air from your home into the furnace). Within the humidifier is a pad, which holds water like a sponge. As the heated air from the supply is bypassed through the humidifier, it picks up evaporated moisture and is run back into the furnace for distribution into your home.A hygrostat (humidifier control &#8211; set manually on the 600M and automatically on the 600A) monitors the humidity in the air and controls a valve to release (or shut off) water running through the humidifier. It is generally mounted on the return plenum from which it measures the relative humidity (RH) in your air.Water running through is a key point here, since when the valve is open, water not only soaks the evaporating pad, but excess water runs through a hose into your drain. I don&#8217;t know how much water is simply &#8211; literally &#8211; poured down the drain, but it doesn't feel good to watch it go. This leads to your first decision &#8211; hooking your humidifier to the hot water or the cold water supply. The hot water humidifies your house more quickly, as it is easier to evaporate, but of course the waste is much more expensive (and it&#8217;s not good for the environment to heat water only to run it down the drain).When the hygrostat determines it is time to run the humidifier, it generally waits for the furnace to come on and send it a signal from the control board (in most modern units). However, you can also install the humidifier to run when the fan is on without the heat (you&#8217;ll need to use the hot water for this). Finally, you can install it so the hygrostat signals the fan to run so that it can humidify your dry house automatically.Automatic v. manual control?It is highly recommended by the manufacturer to keep the humidity low enough in your house to prevent moisture from condensing (or frosting) on your windows, which could cause rot and mildew. The condensation point is a function of the humidity in your house and the temperature of the inside surface of your windows. This is a function of the thickness of your window glass and the temperature outside.The automatic hygrostat (600A) measures the temperature outside your home to drop the humidity when the temperature falls. However, it takes up to three days to make a significant change in your home&#8217;s humidity, and the hygrostat can&#8217;t know what the temperature is going to be over the next three days. The automatic control of the 600A is a bit more expensive, is harder to install, offers more possibilities for malfunctions, and doesn't fully do what you want it to - know the temperature in the future. Still, you&#8217;d have to have more discipline than I have to keep up with the weather forecast and run to the basement every day to manually adjust the unit. Although I chose the manual version based on the recommendations of two plumbers &#8211; one on YouTube and the one who installed my unit &#8211; I believe I would now select the automatic one.Installation was done quickly by a professional for $240 plus $30 in supplies. I was quoted prices up to $500, so be sure to shop around. The work is simple, if you know how to do it, and most plumbers have installed many of these.The maintenance seems simple &#8211; replace the pad annually (about $15), shut off the air bypass valve and the water valve in the spring.

I'm one of those rare-special-occasion-only people. I got this just for transportation purposes.  I don't think it's a perfect solution, but for under $10, I think it's worth the money. Especially for how infrequently I use the thing.The main shaft of the tube is a pretty sturdy metal, as is the bottom screw cap.  Unfortunately (and for reasons unknown) the entire top portion is plastic, including the flip cap and the section that elongates. The only metal part in the top section is the pocket clip. It boggles the mind, frankly -- had the entire tube been metal, this would have gone from \"worth the money\" to a 5-star \"Fanstastic Deal of Incredible Awesomeness\" (or similar variant).Now, I haven't used the thing to actually snuff a lit cigar.  I'm pretty sure it would be fine, but the fact that the top section is plastic (which could melt) bothers me.  Now, the description states:\"Inside this attractive tube there is a cigar snuffer that extinguishes your cigars immediately and keeps it safe until you are ready to finish it.\"Cigar snuffer inside the tube? I'm not sure what they're referring to, but it's a hollow tube. There's nothing in it. I guess \"cigar snuffer\" is media-speak for \"a lit cigar in an enclosed tube will eventually go out due to lack of oxygen\"?But at any rate, as a single-stick case, it works great. The cap is the weak point here though, because when closed it merely sits on top, and since the hinge is plastic, it has some side-to-side movement that makes it feel like it could break off.But for its few bad points, it hasn't failed yet. It's likely that it is actually stronger than it feels when you hold it.All in all, it does what I wanted it to, and it does it for a reasonable price. I think as long as you know you're not getting something that's metal all the way through, you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2009", "summary": "Not Bad, For the Price!"}

Mine, for example, has a very small dent in the stainless steel on its left side. It's not noticable unless you're looking for it, and that alone wouldn't keep me from recommending this coffee maker. (Also, as previous reviewers have noted, this model does NOT come with a permanent filter like the new model does.)What's a little iffier about it, though, are a couple strange design issues that affect usability.Every coffee maker I've ever owned has had a flip-top carafe--but not this one. You have to physically remove the lid to pour water into the carafe--a minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.You need the carafe to measure water, because there's no water-level indicator on the coffee maker itself. Additionally, the water filter takes up a lot of the space under the lid, meaning that there's a relatively small space to pour the water into from the carafe. It's enough room that someone without any mobility problems shouldn't have any issues getting the water in, but it takes a little getting used to.Overall, I'd recommend the reconditioned model of the Brew Central.

Without a lot of experience with various knives, I'm not sure if they are a good value at the current asking price of $300 - but they seem reasonable based on the following.  I have a set ofAnolon Advancedknifes that cost about $150 and came with more knifes (some of which I'll likely never use, though), and these knifes are clearly at least one step up in quality.  They are sharper, feel more balanced, and have a nicer fit and finish on the blades.  After getting these, I bought two Shun Premier knifes.  An equivalent set of those might cost around $500-$600, and I think that the Shuns are better than these Felix knifes in the same categories that the Felix are better than the Anolons.  So, in my limited experience and personal opinions, this set is middle ground in quality, function, aesthetics, and price.I've listed below the aspects that I like and those that I would change.  In general, I think that the whole set is high quality, the knifes are very nice, but the block, while sturdy and aesthetically pleasing, isn't a great functional design.Pros:- Knifes arrived very sharp.  This should be expected, but it's a pro to me because my Anolon knife set had a number of dull knifes when it arrived.  Cutting fruits, vegetables, and meat has been easy with these knifes.- The fit and finish of the knifes.  From what I can tell from researching, the steel is the same as that used in my Anolon knifes, but the overall quality of these knifes is at least one step up.  The have a consistent surface finish and exhibit an attention to detail.- The handles.  I was leary of plastic handles, as I thought that they would feel cheap and uncomfortables.  To my surprise, I really like them!  One of the nicest things to me is that they do not get slippery when I'm hand washing them with soap and water.- The aesthetics and build quality of the knife block.  Not the most functional (see below), but it does showcase the knifes very well.Cons:- The functional aspect of the knife block.  To its credit, the base is heavy and the block will need to be angled fairly far before it will tip over.  There are two things that I don't like about it, though.  First, while it fits under my cabinets just fine, I can't pull any of the knifes out without pulling the block out or angling it.  Sometimes I want to grab a knife when my hands are already wet or messy from handling food, so that isn't nearly as convenient as a knife block that has the handles angled out for grabbing.  Second, the knifes can rattle inside the glass if the set is vibrated.  For example, if you have them on a table and bump the end of the table like I did at first, or possibly if you have them on your counter and run an appliance like a food processor.As a note: the knife block that I received is not quite the same as the one pictured (at least at the time of my review), but instead is identical to the block that comes with thisMercer knife set.  They are very similar, so it's a note and not a criticism.  However, I think that you might be viewing this set based on the aesthetics of the block, so it might be important.  The differences are that the included block contains a metal piece with separators that help with placing the knifes, and two circular ends that screw onto the top of the metal posts to secure that metal piece in place.  That separator isn't installed when the block arrives, so you can use it or not according to your preference.  Without that piece, the block looks nearly identical to that pictured here with the minor exception of two circular end caps (which are the same metal) on the top of the posts.  You can also remove those end caps, but then you'll expose the threaded holes that they screw into.There is nothing about this set that I think is low quality.  The knife block, which I thought looked great in the photo, isn't my preference after being able to try it in person - but it is very well made.  The knifes themselves should last for many years.  Like I mentioned above, I'm happy overall with this set and really like the knifes.UPDATE March 4, 2012:  I like these so much that I bought a set (minus the glass block) for my mom.  She is also quite happy with them and specifically pointed out that she likes the handles on these.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2012", "summary": "High quality knifes, not my favorite block"}

It offers a number of advantages, chief among them that it's extremely light. It's also corded and so is pretty powerful, and it's easy to assemble and use. All very good. Against this are a few disadvantages. At 16 feet, the cord is rather short. Looking at other stick vacuums on Amazon, this doesn't seem to be an unusual length for this type of product, but it is inconvenient. Plug the vacuum in a few feet from the base of your stairs, and you may have trouble doing the entire stairway without moving the cord to a different outlet. The vacuum comes with a crevice tool. The tool has a ring that attaches to the stick of the vacuum, but the connection is not very strong and the thing falls off constantly. Finally, the handle does not feel very strong where it attaches to the vacuum unit. I feel like it would snap if too much pressure were put on it. None of these complaints are a big deal, but they do detract a bit from the user experience. To sum up, here are my pros and cons:PROS-- VERY light weight-- Easy to assemble-- Easy to use (emptying, for example, and putting back together again)-- Corded/powerfulCONS-- 16-foot cord is too short for some tasks-- Crevice tool falls off routinely when in storage position-- Handle doesn't feel solid", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014", "summary": "Lightweight vacuum does a decent job"}

A gas burner with a convection chimney and some propane gas lines. It lights easily and runs more or less as advertised, although as some have pointed out, it does tend to generate yellowish flames instead of solid blue sometimes. I get about 12-15 hours out of a single propane tank, and in my area, this works out to a cost of less than a dollar an hour for operating cost.Still, my experience is different, as I lived through the blizzard of 2013 in the Northeast - over two feet of snow, no power for five days and trapped in my home thanks to numerous downed trees that prevented our roads from being cleared for several days. Yes, I have an emergency generator, and it worked great. But after 48 hours, my generator fuel ran out and in spite of keeping the fireplaces going, it got really cold. As temperatures dipped to single digits outside on the third night, the inside temperatures in my home fell into the mid-thirties.Fearing burst pipes and other damage, I broke down and fired up the Mr. Heater propane heater, right in my kitchen. About an hour of operation brought most of my large home back to about 50 degrees, and from there, we were able to stay warm by running the heater about half an hour every four hours. I know this isn't the intended use of the product, and I suspect it was somewhat dangerous to operate this way - but, boy am I glad I had one of these units (and a bottle of propane!) on hand when I needed it.People might complain about the noise or the flame, and debate whether it's safe to use one of these in an enclosed area But I know that without it, the Blizzard of 2013 would have been a much worse event for me and my family.

It's really the only option for getting a drink in the building, unless of course you bring your own from home.  They charge $2.25 for a cup, then you get free refills for the day.So, I was buying a cup and filling it up on average about twice every single day that I worked.  So I was spending $2.25 per day, or $22.50 every two weeks on nothing but drinks at work.  I wanted to try and cut back on that expense a tad, so I started looking around at all of the options out there.  I knew I didn't want an actual water bottle, and a lady I work with recently got one of the Copco cups in purple.  She really seemed to like it, so I took to Amazon to find one.As is the norm for Amazon, the cup arrived really quickly in a nice sized box.I like it a lot.  It's built well, the straw is nice, and the top screws on securely.  It also seems to keep drinks cold for a really good amount of time.This cup has allowed me to save quite a bit of money.  Now, instead of spending $2.25 per day, I'm buying a single two liter bottle every two days and keeping that in the break room at work, then filling this cup with ice.  The two liter bottle is costing me on average about $1.50 every time I buy it, so I'm spending on average 75 cents per day on my soda, instead of $2.25.  Basically, I'm spending $7.50 every two weeks on soda instead of $22.50.So, this cup paid for itself basically in the first 7 days of me using it, and it's now helping me to save money...and as an added benefit, I'm not throwing away a foam cup and plastic lid every day!I like it.

Apparently, the price keeps going up on these pillows, however I got free shipping from Amazon ($25 minimum order, now $35) on my recent order which more than offset the shipping I paid for direct purchase from the seller last time.  I don't know if the pillow has softened up slightly, settled more in its case, or I have just adjusted to its feel. I'm a semi-side sleeper with large shoulders that I keep angled during sleep (&lt;90 degrees to the bed) and it provides about the right amount of loft for my neck.  Because it barely fits into a stand pillow case when new, the only way it could provide more loft support would be to keep it squeezed up while you're sleeping.9/27/13 - 3 star review:  For my needs, it's slightly too firm.  I think this pillow would have worked well when I was younger and liked a firmer pillow.  It completely fills a standard pillow case but I don't think it overfills the case such that that contributes to its firmness.  I don't know how it can be considered a \"down alternative\" in that it is significantly firmer than any down pillow I've slept on, but maybe that's why it's an alternative.  It's too firm and solid to \"fluff\" up by punching it.  It's firm enough not to\"swallow\" your head and cause breathing pre-warmed air (I like sleeping in a cool room).  This being said, I'm not sure that any pillow can be completely judged objectively, being mostly subject to the individual preferences of the reviewer.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2013", "summary": "Seems well made and comfortable."}

First among them is the size. When I went blender hunting on the internet, I insisted on finding a blender with a larger jar. My old blender held only 36 oz. and I discovered through experience that this size is much too small. I wanted something larger and this blender, with its 48 oz. glass jar, was exactly the size I was looking for. I also wanted more power and that is exactly what I got: A blender with 700 watts of force at its peak.Next, I really like the stylish appearance of this blender. All of my new kitchen appliances are black in color and this appliance is no exception (it is also offered in white, for those who prefer it). Not only does the color make it look slick and attractive, it is also more slender in shape than the blenders of old. The base does spread out a little at the bottom but the overall shape tends toward the vertical, making it easier to fit into a small countertop space and also easier on the eyes.Now for the most important factor: The blending ability. One of the reasons I selected this Hamilton beach model was because of its patented \"Wave Action\" technology. For those who are unfamiliar with this, it is a system that helps to blend drinks and other foods more thoroughly and efficiently via the design of the blades. Most blenders contain four blades that are more or less parallel to the countertop. But with Hamilton Beach Wave Action, two of the four blades are bent upward. This design helps to push ice and liquids down toward the blades for better blending.I was skeptical about the claims made by Hamilton Beach at first but one use made an instant believer out of me. I started by mixing up a frozen drink- something that requires the ice to be crushed into tiny bits. This blender crushed the ice down to tiny particles in a matter of seconds. There was no need to stir the mixture by hand and try again, like with other blenders. The drink was completely mixed, smooth, and delicious. I could not detect even a single piece of ice that was too large. Every last bit of ice was crushed to perfection!Overall, I am very happy with my Hamilton Beach Ensemble Model 54245 Wave Action Blender and I have no regrets about spending the extra money to obtain it. It not only looks good, it performs its main task with ease and perfection. Drinks come out silky smooth in a matter of seconds thanks to the Wave Action technology, making this Hamilton Beach Blender an appliance that I will continue to use and enjoy for a good long time.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2007", "summary": "Wave Action Technology?

I like how the alarm goes off when it reaches the temperature you desire. I don't have to keep running back, opening the oven, and play the guessing game or use a smaller or bulkier probe in a hot oven. And because the main unit stays outside the oven, I don't have to worry about opening the door and letting the heat out. My foods never came out undercooked when I used the probe to the temperatures I needed. My cooking became almost carefree. I didn't have to worry anymore about incessantly watching the clock and wondering if the meat's done.My minor complaints are similar to others: the magnet could be stronger (I still might have mine now) and storing the probe can be a pain since it's so wiry.

Take the tub out 30 minutes before you want to serve. Hold the top under hot water for a minute before you try to open it. The ice cream will be rock solid inside so it needs to thaw a bit. They always tell you to do this with ice cream anyway but few of us have the patience. Also, leave a bit of space when you fill it. It makes it easier to open.

The bag is small and would fill up fast, and a full-size vacuum is much more efficient. However, this little vacuum is great for quick touch-ups when you want to keep things looking fresh and don't want to haul out your big heavy vacuum. For its size it has great suction, and there's a nice variety of attachments. There's not really any convenient way to store all the attachments, but I've found that to be the case with every vacuum I've ever owned. I just pulled out an old gym bag and stashed all the attachments in there.One of the things I love best about this vacuum is the soft brush attachment I can use for dusting. I'm a big Dustbuster fan, and have always wished I could use it for dusting, but it scratches wood surfaces. So this Oreck is a great solution. I do wish the hose and maybe even the wand attachment were even longer, but I understand the limitations of keeping the unit compact.If you have back or neck or shoulder problems, this is probably not the vacuum for you. It doesn't have wheels, so you have to either hold it by the handle or sling it over your shoulder while you're vacuuming. If you set it on the floor, it falls over on its side during use, and if you don't want to carry it you have to drag it along the floor while you vacuum.I like this unit most for hard surfaces such as wood and linoleum.

While the steam from popping melts it so it drops on the popcorn, too much liquid causes the popcorn to shrivel up. I learned that one the hard way.

What follows is my evaluation and the overall star-rating.3-stars - Height adjustment. Height can be set easily but the plastic ring used to lock in a specific height cracked while I was turning it, probably because I used too much force. It's good that it extends a lot but it's not clear who would want speakers sitting on top of a 50-inch tall thin pole. Maybe a lower minimum height would have been more helpful.4-stars - Stability. It's okay when set at the minimum height but I don't know how steady it would be if extended to the max and placed on a carpeted floor.4-stars - Design. They look alright with black speakers on them. Speaker wire goes through the tube. The 'oak accents' reference in the Amazon description must have come from another product - there are no oak accents of on these stands.3-stars - Speaker mounting. The 4 holes provided should work well with satellite speakers that have 4 holes in the base but mine didn't. I had to use the provided sticky tape and this should do but I'm ready to replace it with Velcro if needed. It wasn't easy to get the 16-gauge wire out of the tube and around the screws keeping the mounting platform in place but, eventually, all was okay.I had issues with mounting the speakers, running the wire through the poles and one plastic part cracked but, in the end, I am using these stands.

Yup - it loses an entire 4.5&#34; of length and 4.5&#34; of width by the time you reach the bottom. That is a DRAMATIC difference from the provided dimensions in the item description.

Here are some tips on doing that.We bought a 2.2 liter pump thermos.  Yes, this kettle is 1.7 liter, but wait.  Every day we throw in 5 bags of green tea and a little less than a cup of cold water.  Careful how you rip off the string so you don't open up the bags; we find that holding the staple between finger and thumb while pulling the string keeps the bag intact.  We somewhat overfill this kettle (no sign of a problem ever) with water to the middle of the circle you'll see on the inside, bring that to a boil, and add it to the thermos.With green tea you do *not* want to add boiling water, because it makes the tea bitter.  But the bit of cold water you put in first brings the temperature down just enough, and adds enough volume that it fills the 2.2L container.  That's one day of tea for the two of us -- imagine the antioxidants!  Note that the tea darkens throughout the day, so that by the end it is more like oolong tea.We have done this 200-300 times now, and all is well.  This is hugely more convenient, and faster, than either heating water in a microwave or heating water on the stove.  And it doesn't heat up the house like the stove does.  We try to avoid ingesting foods/liquids heated in plastic, so stainless steel was a must for us even though it added a lot to the price.Sounds like some other folks have had reliability problems -- it may be that heating full loads is the best case for kettles like this, since there's no chance of the element being exposed and overheating.-- An update --This thing is still going after several years.  The only problem is that the button which opens the lid doesn't always work.  It's no big deal -- I can just pull the lid up with my hand -- but of course it would be better if it just worked!  :^)", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 26, 2006", "summary": "Works great for making a thermos of green tea"}

In other words, there's no such thing as a 1,500 Watt unit that gives more heat than another of the same wattage in the same enclosed space.This unit uses a quiet, but relatively high volume fan that puts out a lukewarm heat.  It isn't hot and isn't an IR radiant heater. It isn't going to be a dramatic warmer for somebody standing/sitting in front of it just in from the cold.  It is designed to maintain the warmth of the air of a room.The fan is very safe and will shut down if it gets too hot.  It doesn't use an old fashioned 'tip over' sensor (which was typically mercury based), which means you could mount this to the ceiling or wall if you wanted to, for whatever reason.The thermostat is a bit unconventional.  When set, it will keep the room at the temp set... as long as the room is already at that temp.  You'll likely want to keep it maxed out to get full heating.  On the flip-side, you can dial it down at night until the fan speed is on low to keep things quiet.  It will still be hot, but automatically kick up as things cool to try to warm you up.It's very light in weight, has high/low controls for temp, continuous/auto fan. You can use it as a regular fan in the summer without heat. And, it doesn't reset controls when the power is lost so you can use it with a wall timer or power switch.Last note, it may interfere with electronics, namely audio equipment with a 'buzz' as it draws a lot of electrical current using it's electronic thermostat.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2013", "summary": "Efficient heater for maintaining temp"}

This product is amazing and just what I've been looking for; something lightweight/portable with enough suction to do a fantastic dusting job.  It has a nice long cord so you don't have to be constantly switching outlets whenever you move more than 10 feet in any direction.  It comes with a handy shoulder strap and all the basic cleaning attachments you need, plus as a neat tool carrier that attaches to the vacuum.  One of the things that really stands out is, that for the money, this vacuum is especially well-built. Also, not having to replace vacuum bags and having a hepa-filter are two more pluses.Please don't misunderstand my enthusiasm, I'm not suggesting that this should be a replacement for your standard rug vacuum or shop-vac, although in a pinch I'm sure it could do the job.  But for me, it's more for picking up dust that continually clings to electronic devices, i.e. computers, monitors, tv's, stereos, etc.  It's also very nice for getting dust and cob-webs off ceilings, ceiling fans and the upper molding/edges of your rooms. Works well on venetian blinds and for getting dust/dirt out of close quarters like closets.  If you're in the market for a handy to use, well made small portable vacuum that's reasonably priced, then this is something to consider.

I am not one to sit and read directions beginning to end. This one, I took out of the box and scanned the safety precautions etc. In 5 minutes I had juice--it was that easy to work. There aren't a lot of complicated parts. The clean up was also easy--two minutes tops. There are four major parts--the top, the blade part and the encasement for that, the plunger. Easy-peasy. The amount of juice this machine produces is incredible! I can't believe I lived without this thing. I make juice twice a day since it arrived 8 days ago. It sits neatly on my counter top and is not intrusive at all. If I want juice, it's probably 5 minutes--make the juice and clean up all in 5. Done.

Brush the tops with melted butter, sprinkle on herbs, oats, seeds, whatever you like, and bake.You don't have to stick your finger in some fat little white blobby guy's belly to get giggles of delight.A great option versus muffin tin for cupcakes and sweet treats like muffins and banana bread.

Unlike several people on here, I don't see where the camo pattern is \"cartoon-ish\" or anything of the sort. The leaves aren't ultra bright yellow (sure, they could have made them a browner color) and there aren't big blotches of pink area and little camo pattern. The lighter colored (tan) branches could have been designed to appear more lively, but I wouldn't classify them as \"cartoon-ish\".The things I am, however, displeased with are the size, thickness, and material of the comforter. I purchased a queen comforter and it barely covers my queen bed. The material is NOT microfiber; it feels like a cheap, scratchy material. It also is very, very thin. It's about as thin as a duvet cover. Thankfully, I have a white down/alt. comforter that I use with everything; so it makes my bed look a bit fuller and adds to the length of the comforter. If you DO like the pattern and are displeased with the thickness/length as I was, purchase a white comforter to put underneath. I would not recommend using this to cover up with, either.Also, I don't know what sort of comforter comes without pillow shams. Solid black will do, I guess.Let's be honest: This comforter was barely $40. It's not going to be Realtree, Mossy Oak, or Browning. Those are more than double the price. This is equivalent to the fake leather Coach bags sold at flea markets, but I'm not complaining too much. It still looks cute on my bed.Update: I've had this comforter for nearly a week now and am noticing how thin its getting, as I have been covering up with it at night. The stuffing is starting to bunch up and move around, leaving a ton of excess material on the perimeter of the blanket. Also, a friend of mine has the actual Realtree set and I got to see it over the weekend. Now that I've seen it in person, I can understand why people say that this one is cartoon-ish. The Realtree one looks incredibly realistic, and is very fluffy and substantial. While I'm still not complaining too much because this was inexpensive, I am going to invest into purchasing a real Realtree set. This one is great for covering up while on the couch or to use at camp.If you are expecting this to closely match up to a Realtree design, I wouldn't recommend purchasing. While the design does resemble a woods-like camo, it does not have that \"lively\" factor that Realtree delivers.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013", "summary": "I don't love it, but it'll do."}

We don't use zip locks anymore, preferring various reusable products like tupperware, snack taxis and wrap n mats.  These are a really nice addition to our collection.  I like them better than the heavy snack taxis for things like grapes, pretzels, cheese sticks, celery sticks, etc.  They are easy to wash as they are nice and sturdy.  They do need to be propped open to dry on the drying rack, but can also be very easily wiped dry.  The zip closure is really easy to use, though my sense is that it will eventually break... I don't have a feel for how long it will last, but it actually does feel a lot sturdier than I would expect..it might surprise me and last a good long time.  Also, for those with concerns about plastic, the packaging does specify \"Tested for lead safety and phthalates.  PVC, BPA and latex-free.\"However, be aware that these are more for the types of snacks I described.  The snack size bag is too narrow and trim to fit a half sandwich and the sandwich bag won't actually fit a full sandwich.  For those, we stick with the wrap n mats or snack taxis.Also, as other posters have described, this has nothing to do with the description currently listed with this product, which I imagine will eventually be fixed.  They do not stand for loading and are not insulated, among other mis-described things in the listing.UPDATE: After about one or two more uses the zip closure on the big bag broke.  :-(If you are looking for a reusable-type zip lock bag, this does seem like a cute one.

The first thing that I noticed when I opened this set is that the set is so well made and the utensils are heavy, yet fit perfectly in my hand and comfortable to hold and the set overall feels and looks like a professional set. Here are the Pros I have found:PROS:+ Each utensil is coated with a non-slip surface, making it easy to handle and grip. I have already used this set for making hamburgers and the slotted spatula did a wonderful job with my hamburgers. Also the Spoonula I used to mix a serve a casserole dish and it did a great job.+ Replaced 10 of my old utensils with these 5 essential utensils: 1) Slotted Spoon, 2) Stirring Spoon, 3) Slotted Turner 4) Ladle (for soups, stews or gravies) 5) Spoonula (this is a spoon/spatula combination for stir frying, mixing, anytime you need a spatula).+ Like that these are heat resistant and I can use them for stove-top cooking and baking.Hint #1 - These utensils each have a hole in them so you can hang them on a wall in the kitchen so you can get to these easily and they decorate your kitchen as well!Hint #2 - Also a suggestion, what I did was to place 5 piece set into my White Tall Ceramic Holder.

From the grocery store on sale to Costco, it has been a long quest. I read the Amazon reviews and settled on this product, buying both sizes.  I am very pleased. Some reviews said the quality was not that good, but if you look closer, you will see that you can buy these bag rolls in regular and commercial grade. The commercial grade is heavier than the Food Saver brand rolls, and I find them to be very, very good. The other objection is that this over-size roll does not fit into the Food Saver.  True.  However, when you lift the Food Saver lid, there is a small gap.  Just put the roll behind the Food Saver, thread through the small gap, and then you can seal the end and cut to the size you wish as you have always done.  This bag roll will hang over the Food Saver controls, but I find that you can still see the controls well enough to operate. I use my Food Saver a lot with bulk purchases and my home smoker.

This product looked just perfect, and I liked that the display looked nice and big and easy to read (no having to struggle to read it when it's in a discreet location inside the fridge, I hoped).But, within 1 minute of sticking this product to the fridge, it fell down.  Lucky we had set it in a place where it wouldn't have far to fall (just in case it did fall), or else I suspect this would have broken right then.We stuck it back up, hoping for better luck next time.  Unfortunately, the product stayed put for less than a few minutes before falling down again.We tried a third, a fourth, a fifth time, but this product just won't stay stuck.  We've ended up having to leave it on the refrigerator shelf, which is very annoying when I specifically brought this product so we wouldn't have to do that!  I may buy something better in the future.As for the thermometer itself---we've only been using it a few days so it's difficult to say just how reliable it is.  The temperature readouts do seem to fluctuate - we left the thermometer in the fridge and checked the temperature every 2 hours, and got about six degrees difference in readouts.I brought this product because I need to make sure my medication is stored at the correct temperature, so obviously accuracy of readings is important.

It isn't something that gets down deep into pile carpet, but for surface dirt it works great.  And on hardwoods, there is nothing better.Our Shark Navigator Pro is also a winner.  That is mostly used upstairs and for deep cleaning the area rugs downstairs  every so often as this little one cannot get deep down into carpets.The battery still gets at least 20 minutes of use before it stops working.

It seems to have a lot of suction, and it weighs much less than either the B&D; or the DD, making it easier to tote around.Most importantly, I see that users can replace the battery on this Shark, and it seems quite easy to do.I have deducted one star just because this vac doesn't have an on-board brush or crevice tool, features I liked about the Dirt Devil.I also appreciate the fact that you can sit this vac upright on the counter when you're not using it, saving valuable counter space.  The Dirt Devil could only splay out on the counter like a beached whale unless you mounted the charger on the wall, which many said wasn't advisable, as the charger kept coming loose from the wall.Some have said that the higher the voltage, the better the performance of a hand vac.  I'm still not convinced that is necessarily true.  This Shark is only 12 volts, but it seems to perform as well as the 18-volt Dirt Devil.I'll report back if this Shark lets me down.  In the meantime, I give it thumbs up, and just wish it had a retractable brush or crevice tool.UPDATE: after using this Shark for a number of weeks now, I must say that I am impressed with how long it continues to work on each battery charge and how powerful the suction is.  This again leads me to believe that higher voltage alone does NOT mean a better cordless vacuum, as this 12-volt model works better than the higher-voltage Dustbuster and Dirt Devil units I had before. Plus, this Shark is lighter weight, and thus easier to tote about, than those two.  Really, the only negative I can report is the lack of an on-board brush or crevice tool.  Otherwise this is a great hand vac and a bargain to boot.PROS:* Powerful suction.* Long run time on each battery charge.* Reasonably priced.* Lightweight.* Replaceable battery.CONS:* No on-board brush or crevice tool.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2014", "summary": "No Snark for this Shark"}

The air conditioner comes with a remote, so you can set the temperature, or turn it on or off, without needing to get out of bed.  The deluxe features are all you could ask for.  For example, the fan has three speed settings, along with an AUTO setting, which changes the fan speed to correspond to higher heat levels. You can also select FAN ONLY, to circulate air without chilling it.  The SLEEP function raises the temperature of the room by 4 degrees over a 1 hour period. The machine also has a CLEAN AIR button, that uses an ionizer to help remove dust and pollen from the room.  You can also turn the device on and off with a timer, which is perfect if you want the air conditioner to kick on about an hour before you get home from work.  Another excellent idea is this indoor/outdoor lever.  If you want to draw in cool air from outside, the air conditioner offers you that option.  You save money not only through the efficiency of the machine's design, but also thru smart use of these auto on and off features (Energy Saver mode, sleep mode, timer, etc).

Also the air conditioner is heavy, and requires two people to lift it, and place it in the window.  When you get the box from UPS, it will have a TEAM LIFT sticker on the box, because one person shouldn't try to lift it themselves.

While I'd lived in houses, even technically owned houses before, this was the first home I picked for myself, and I think this lead to imagining a Martha Stewart vision of myself. So, I bought dishes, and pots and pans, and bake wear that fit this fantasy. Some of it worked out and some didn't. What seems perfect in a catalog or in a store can perform differently when put into use in an actual kitchen.One of my early purchases was mixing bowls. Really heavy mixing bowls. They looked like something from an earlier generation, and that appealed to me. For the past several years, every time I've needed one of those bowls, I'd stood on tiptoe to reach them and braced myself for the weight. My grandmother, who lives with us, had a hard time handling them as well. With my new kitchen island, I've eliminated the tiptoe thing, and now -- with these new OXO bowls -- I've eliminated the other issue.I like that the colors are still in line with the look I like and remind me of my childhood and bowls passed down from an even earlier generation than that. They have a modern light-weight feel though, and are made not to skid. The heavier bowls can stay up on the high shelf in the cabinet -- I've found the bowls I can use daily. Yesterday I marinated chicken drumsticks in the large bowl and today I might try a test run of a cupcake recipe I want to use for Valentine's Day.In the end, what I craved when I bought the original kitchen supplies was a sense of home and belonging -- consumerism and advertising at its best. However, practical supplies for a working, functioning kitchen -- supplies that help produce nutritious and delicious meals -- do a better job of making home a reality.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2010", "summary": "The Right Bowls For My Kitchen"}

They are expensive but are definitely a cut above the rest. (Sorry for the pun) When I first received this Wusthof Executive Chefs Knife Set my immediate thought when taking them out was Wow. They are impressive to look at. What was even more impressive was the way they cut. You don't push down on these knives, you simply glide them over the food and the knife falls to the table. I was able to cut near see through thin slivers of tomatoes. These are scary sharp.The balance, the way the handle cradles your hand, the action of cutting all add up to more than just something to chop vegetables, these actually create a top chef feeling and experience. You almost want to hold your hand graciously when using these. It makes you want to up your entire cooking game. I know this sounds like an exaggeration but it is true. I love these things.Although there is everything you may need to dress your veggies, the main event is the 3 piece knife set. I was seeing pro chefs on TV making cuts into veggies in a rocking motion, and they were using the same style of knife, one where the wide part of the knife takes up the greatest amount of its length, and the taper drops off more quickly at the end. So I got a craving for one of them, and this set has two variations of that exact same configuration.I am not a professional chef but I have a good deal of money invested in my Henkel's, and let me tell it to you straight, these are on a different shelf, strictly top drawer.

While it references the power button, it does not identify it (I guess consumers must figure that out on their own). It does not identify the three fan speeds/cleaning power settings (you finally understand how to select them when you read further in the instructions).While the product may have been designed in the U.S., I'm guessing the owner's manual was produced overseas, by a foreign team with no clue regarding owner manual usability or information development.Once you get past that, the product seems to work as advertised.UPDATEWhen the unit is powered off, the green LED Power button light cycles on and off continually. It's especially annoying at night. I sent an email to Hoover customer service outlining in detail the issue, asking if that's usual/typical or if it indicated that something needed to be addressed. I received an email response addressing the red light that indicates the HEPA filter needs to be changed -- which has absolutely nothing to do with my particular issue. Huh? I called Hoover customer service, and after holding for the next available representative for 15 minutes, selected the option for a call back. Four hours later, I spoke with a CS representative, who was unaware of my issue, and placed me on hold a couple of times for 5 minutes while I assume she went to another location to actually test the model. She finally stated that the \"cycling\" Power button light was normal. Hmmmmm. Might be useful information to include in the owner's manual, ya think?I'm really disappointed that a quality company like Hoover, that manufactures quality products, would completely drop the ball on something as important as an owner's manual.

It was an old Nesco that I had for the past 20 years and I inherited from my aunt who had owned it for several years. Faced with the prospect of trying to cook both and turkey and a ham for Thanksgiving, I did a no-brainer and bought this item which was seasonally priced.I decided that in anticipation of the holiday and not wanting to have any issues or surprises, i'd take it on a test ride with a 12 pound bird. I'm not sure if the newness of this roaster compelled me to move forward with this test, but it turned out to be a good idea.The cooking instructions are pretty basic in regard to what the manufacturer provides so i ended up winging this with cookbook instructions for roasting a small bird. As it turned out, this little gobbler was done earlier than anticipated by a good 45 minutes. I had liberally greased this bird up with a combination of unmelted butter and sage liberally spread under the bird's skin and turned the unit on set to 350 degrees fahrenheit and ignored it until the last hour and a half. By the time the thermometer registered done, the skin was a beautiful golden dark brown and the skin was very crisp. From the drippings I made gravy which was excellent.Clean up was pretty easy but it did require nominal elbow grease. To make the process easier, i filled the porcelain well which is removeable with water and a squirt of Dawn. Dawn is the magic bullet because it breaks grease down quickly. I let the Dawn/water simmer on my stove top as I washed my other pots, pans, and serving ware. Took about 20 minutes total. Most of the nasty mess was emulsified. I scrubbed a couple of stubborn spots, washed the lid and well, and wiped down the exterior surface with a damp paper towel.While an 18 quart capacity might seem iffy if you cook big turkeys, this roaster can accommodate a 23 pound turkey because my old roaster did and this is the same size.My only advice regarding this roaster is that this cooks fast, so be prepared if the turkey cooks quickly. My advice is to turn off the heat source and keep the bird in the roaster with the lid on until you are ready to carve the bird.Pluses are large capacity, a well fitting lid that retains moisture, and the porcelain interior that is either chip proof or chip resistant. The only negative is that this cooks quickly.This is a nice roaster given its price and its performance.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2013", "summary": "Surprisingly Large Interior/Performed Well"}

Relatively low amounts of ozone can cause chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and, throat irritation. It may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma as well as compromise the ability of the body to fight respiratory infections.Some studies show that ozone concentrations produced by ozone generators can exceed health standards even when one follows manufacturer&#8217;s instructions.Many factors affect ozone concentrations including the amount of ozone produced by the machine(s), the size of the indoor space, the amount of material in the room with which ozone reacts, the outdoor ozone concentration, and the amount of ventilation. These factors make it difficult to control the ozone concentration in all circumstances.Available scientific evidence shows that, at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is generally ineffective in controlling indoor air pollution.The concentration of ozone would have to greatly exceed health standards to be effective in removing most indoor air contaminants. In the process of reacting with chemicals indoors, ozone can produce other chemicals that themselves can be irritating and corrosive.Top of pageRecommendationThe public is advised to use proven methods of controlling indoor air pollution.

We live at THE GREENE apartments which bills itself as Dayton's premier luxury apartments and they can't even provide proper fitting shower rods....this place is a dump with management that won't spend a penny to fix ANYTHING....we moved in to find seriously stained toilet seats in both bathrooms...which I'm pretty sure that county health code requires landlords to provide NEW toilet seats to new residents).  We purchased our own properly fitting shower rods and these rods (two bathrooms) fits tight and firm and gets the job done.  It looks like quality instead of cheap plastic from Wal-Mart (where one only finds cheap...never lasting quality).  If you need a new rod that looks good and works great....this is the one.

You need NO tools, the screws are all the same. and it's pretty basic. The longest board goes on top and the shorter ones in between. Bet you will do it faster than I did, because you won't assemble it at 4am and put the boards upside-down. Even with that I think 15 minutes and it was sturdy. I really recommend this.

I own a large blender and recently gave away an expensive juicer after deciding that the Tribest Single Serving Blender is far more practical for my type use. First, the small footprint for this blender is a big plus as it resides on the kitchen countertop ready for instant use. Clean-up relative to the juicer and large blender is a huge time saver, and makes this device extremely versatile and easy for everyday use. It seems well made and durable. A small distraction is that frozen fruit or ice sometimes gets lumped and requires unscrewing the lid and stirring with a spatula (shaking sometimes alleviates this minor problem). Another minor inconvenience is the polycarbonate containers and blade assembly are not dishwasher safe, and must be hand-washed. Overall, however, this is a fantastic kitchen appliance.Tribest's marketing of it's single serving blenders is a bit confusing. The base motor is the same regardless of which series you decide to purchase (i.e., 200 watt; 1/4 hp), and your decision comes down to accessories you want. The following breakdown may help you:* PB-100 (2 blender containers & 1 four-prong blender blade; $50 price range)* PB-200 (same as PB-100 PLUS 2 grinder containers & 1 two-prong grinder blade; $60 price range)* PB-300 (1/ea. blender & grinder containers instead of 2/ea. w/ PB-200 PLUS 4 glass mason jars & mason jar attachment; $70 price range)* For more precise details of included accessories, see the following reference sources:[...]Depending on their marketing channels, the three main series (i.e., PB-100, 200, or 300) may be sold by distributors by another number so carefully check what is included. The bottom line is to purchase the accessories pieces that you think you might use as it will be considerably more costly to buy these separately in the future, especially if having to pay for shipping. For that reason, the $10 price difference between the PB-200 & PB-300 series made it seem sensible for me to buy the Tribest PB-350 Mason Jar Personal Blender & Grinder as featured here. While I've only used several of the accessories so far, the others are expected to be used as I further explore more possibilities for this time saving blender.While wondering whether this kitchen gadget would be put to good use, it has far exceeded my expectations. I won't be without one of these small blenders going forward!!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2010", "summary": "Versatile & Everyday Use"}
