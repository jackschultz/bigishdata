About 5 years ago, when I adopted my dog, my cats were not happy, to say the least.  One of them started to urinate every night on the window curtain, coffee table or other flat surfaces to express her anger at me for allowing the dog into the house.  I purchased the Feliway product and put one of these in every room, hoping that it would calm her down.It didn't help with her urination, or her anxiety at all.  But, it definitely made my other cats calmer overall - less frustration in the house, in general.  I have given this to my neighbor, who adopted a new stray cat.  He seemed to be very upset being indoors permanently, and was spraying around the house.  After plugging in this product, in only two rooms (the two rooms that he was spraying in), he stopped spraying and generally became more content.This product is the refill for the unit that you plug into any electrical outlet.  It contains 6 refills - they are small plastic bottles which insert into the plastic plug in device.  It works just like any of the liquid air diffusers - you plug it in and the liquid is heated and becomes vapor which moves through the air.  After about a month, the liquid has been used up and you simply replace it.In summary, if you have a distressed cat for whatever reason, I suggest that you try this.  It is pretty expensive if you buy this in a store (for example, I purchased the device originally from Petsmart) but it's a great price if you buy it here.  I haven't use this in a while (as my cat has since passed away due to health issues, which were probably the cause of her discomfort which explains why this didn't work for her...).  But, I think that I will plug these in again and see if they can make my kitty household a bit happier.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2012", "summary": "Doesn't work on all cats"}

Let me give you my experiences with it.First of all, it's a really big vacuum and I think it's heavy.  (someone else reviewed it and said it was light but I don't think so)  Putting it together wasn't hard, but I still have problems with the piece on the back top that you are supposed to loop over the tubing on and hold the cord.  It has no screws to keep it in, it just &#34;pops&#34; in.  The problem is that it also just kind of &#34;pops&#34; out all the time.  It's so annoying.The vacuum does have strong suction and really does pick up a lot of dog hair - except when you use it as an attachment to sweep couches and furniture.  Then I think it really does fail.  The pet hair just doesn't come up completely and I feel like it's a waste of time.Cleaning out the unit is easy for the bottom part of the bowl - it comes right out and can be emptied into the trash.  The upper part isn't very handy to clean - I've taken to using a curtain rod piece to dig up there to get stuff out, but it all falls onto the open area and makes a huge mess.

At the current price on Amazon of $34.58, that works out to about $11.50 per day, or over $4000 per year.  The 21-lb bag would work out to $3.27 per day, or $1,193 per year.  So the larger bag is an absurdly better deal, although it might still be out of most people's budgets for dog food.  Even if you have a tiny dog, it's probably a good idea to spring for the larger bag and just store it.But how about the food itself?  I am largely impressed with the ingredients list.  Salmon really is the first ingredient, and then it's followed by many whole foods.  There is no indication on the package about whether or not the salmon is sustainably caught, or where it was harvested.  If you care about the source of your salmon, I'd assume the worst, since they are not advertising wild-caught, Alaskan, or anything like that.  From  the Salmon buying guide at Summer Tomato, &#8220;Farmed salmon are raised in large, densely packed pens that pollute surrounding waters with waste and chemicals. In addition, farmed salmon are more prone to illness in crowded net-pens, and antibiotics are often used to treat disease.&#8221;  So that's probably a concern with this food.Another issue with this food is the presence of &#8220;Chicken Liver Flavor,&#8221; which, make no mistake, is NOT actually chicken liver, as well as &#8220;Natural Flavors.&#8221;  If &#8220;Chicken Liver Flavor&#8221; were actually chicken liver, it would just say so, instead of adding the &#8220;flavor&#8221; after it.  There are whole companies that market flavorings (often loaded with MSG) to food companies.  And, of course, &#8220;Natural Flavors&#8221; is a well-known pseudonym for MSG.  MSG is an ingredient that many people have a problem with (if you don't know why, do a quick web search for MSG truth), and among other problems it is known to be linked with obesity. If you're struggling to keep your pet's weight in check, having this ingredient in the food is problematic.The upshot is that this is not the Holy Grail of dog foods, but it is MUCH better than grain-based foods.  The first ingredient of any good dog food should be an animal protein, and the presence of wheat or grains should be avoided as much as possible.For what it's worth, my dog loved this food and tolerated it just fine.  It's a definite step up from less expensive foods, and, as long as you buy the large bags, the cost can be within reason.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014", "summary": "Good--but not the Holy Grail of dog foods"}

He can also be a bit of a picky eater so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible weight gaining ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight Dry Dog Food;Pros+ A nice healthy variety of chicken, fruits, vegetables and supplements.+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up quickly with no fuss.+ No soy, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.+ Lean ingredients designed to help your dog lose and maintain a healthy weight.+ My dog had no digestive issues after eating this.Cons- Contained a few questionable ingredients for your dog such as corn gluten meal, dried beet pulp and tomato pomace.- A bit expensive for an 30-pound bag.  If you have multiple dogs the price will get a bit hefty.- No glucosamine and chondroitin.  These are crucial joint supplements for overweight dogs and I'm surprised to not see them included.- Kibble may be too large for smaller or older dogs.- No way to reseal the bag after opening.- Not Grain Free.My dog really enjoyed Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight Dry Dog Food.  He was of course extremely excited when I approached with the bag (as he is with every new food) and quickly ate the half cup I mixed into his bowl.  His current food isNutrience Grain Free Dog Food, 18-Pound, Ocean Fishwhich he really enjoys.  After introducing him to Hill's Science Diet he still seems to prefer the Nutrience brand.  Currently I'm still mixing the two foods until both are gone at which point I'll completely return to this Grain Free Ocean Nutrience.  Although the price may be a bit more to purchase on a regular basis, I feel the savings will outweigh the cost of unnecessary veterinary visits due to weight gain caused by questionable ingredients in other foods.  If you're willing to pay a little extra for your dog's food in hopes of keeping them happy and healthy, then you may want to give Hill's Science Diet Perfect Weight Dry Dog Food a try.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2014", "summary": "A well balanced weight maintenance dry food from Hills Science Diet"}

I'm not sure if the leather tale is directly connected to the nose loop or if its just very well secured, but it has not shown ANY sign that its going to come off despite Meeko's nearly ritualistic gnawing and pulling on it. The nose loop is very secure as well and has not come off of the fishing lure connector that comes on the Da Bird pole once and shows no signs of getting ready to detach from the body (which is more than I can say for most of the name brand Da Bird refills we've tried).The only little bit of mess you get from this one is the bristles that make up the body. They certainly don't litter the floor like an over-loved catnip mouse, but they do pull off at a pretty constant rate (pretty much from the first catch you'll see a few on your cat's face). They aren't bad and in a few weeks haven't made the toy any less mouse like (although the body is getting a little more sparse), but if you're a neat freak you might need to stick to your laser pointer or a jingle ball (but where's the fun in that).For my money I'll certainly be back.

I was definitely skeptical but since my poor cat got teary eyes & acted lethargic a few times a month from his virus, I decided these couldn't hurt to try. I tried him out on 1 a day and within a week, his eyes cleared up and he was perky again! After a couple of weeks I upped him to 2 a day but he started catching the virus again, so backed him down to 1 a day and for the past 3 months now, no symptoms of the virus at all! I'm so excited to have found these, and luckily for me, my cat LOVES them! He waits in his what I call \"treat spot\" for them and pretty much inhales them as soon as they're in front of him. Some people on here have said their cats wouldn't touch them so I tried a small piece on another one of my cats and they ate it, but weren't as excited about it as my other one was but didn't avoid it either so guess it depends on the cat's taste preference. Reviewers also said theirs were a very hard texture, the ones I've received have always been very soft, I easily peel them into pieces so my cat thinks he's getting more, and because they're pretty big to eat whole. So those that receive hard ones might want to return them, might be a bad batch. My cat's vet gave us a little bottle of Lysine chewables to try a while back when he was diagnosed with the virus, and it held about 20 chewables in it and cost me over $16! I saw these on Amazon and wondered if they were the same ones. They were identical and for a FRACTION of the price for 120 pieces (so giving him 1 a day, they last about 4 months)!

It's the best odor control I've found.  It doesn't stick to my long-haired cats butts and create a clumpy mess that has to be clipped out of their pantalones (a major issue with long-haired cats and clumping litter).  It eradicates the litter box smell better than anything else I've found.  It doesn't have a strong or chemical smell.  To top it off, the cats prefer it to anything else I've tried and all adapted to it immediately.  It also tracks less than the other options.The only issues I've had are:  1. It's a pain in the neck to order it and then wait for a week for it to show up; 2. Because of the larger chunk size I had to find a scoop with larger holes than average and that was a bit of a pain; and 3. The chunk size is too big to work with the littermaid I own.... the thick plastic tines just acted like a shovel, instead of a scoop -- and it's just too expensive to be throwing clean litter out when it's still good like that.Green tea litter vs. keep using the LitterMaid?....  the green tea litter won and the LitterMaid has been retired.... yeah, the green tea litter is better at lowering litterbox hassle than the self-scooper.If the chunk size was small enough to work well with the littermaid, this would be 5 stars.I did just order an OmegaPaw rolling litterbox to try with it -- hopefully that will work out and make cleaning the box easier -- with 8 cats I need all the help I can get.Update......It's too chunky for the \"roll n clean\" grid.... it WILL go through, but instead of slowly roll it one way, then roll it back, pull out the tray and dump it, then roll back further to put the clean litter back.... it's slowly roll it forward to tilting toward the end..... spend a couple of minutes shaking the heck out of it to get the non-clumped litter through the grid, finish rolling it and then roll it back, dump the drawer and then roll it back the other way and shake the heck out of it again to get the clean litter back in the other direction.....  a workout which pretty much takes the ease of use of the \"roll n clean\" away.  I'm contemplating modifying the roll n clean and then retrying with larger slots to see if that works.  Decided to try a LitterMaid Ultra Mega because of the wire tines in the rake and the larger gaps between and it still raked way too much clean litter -- acting more like a shovel than a rake.

Even if it does fit the door space on your particular model, it's a horrible constriction of cage use because you will have to remove it every time you need to gain access to the inside of the cage to handle the animals or change food and water, which will disturb the birds and anything inside the nest box. The Vision cage, unlike almost every bird cage, comes with no breeding doors to allow placement of a nest box on the exterior of the cage, which is essentially an industry standard even in cages designed for companion birds.This is too large to fit inside a cage as it needs to be placed in a top corner for most species (excluding budgerigars), which uses valuable real estate, and makes access to the nest box difficult. I had to cut several bars on the left side of the cage in order to give access to the entrance hole of the nest box which I placed on the outside. This is something no consumer should have to do and it is a grievance because it causes permanent damage.For the nest box itself, I find the plastic material to be preferable to wood because it discourages chewing and it is much more sanitary in addition to being easier to clean than traditional wooden nest boxes. It's relatively easy to get together the first time. I don't like that it isn't completely \"airtight\" except for the entrance hole because it allows light to intrude and could be a risk for even the slightest drafts to chicks (which are dangerous in a bird room anyway). Regarding the green door that slides up for observation, the lip around the bottom connecting part is not high enough to contain a good amount of nesting material inside, which is yet another design flaw considering how close the round nest bowl is placed to this observation door. The box is apparently designed with the slick plastic trays so nesting material doesn't need to be used, but if something like shavings is not used a breeder risks producing chicks with splayed legs.In short, the use of plastic in this is a very good thing, but the way it comes together in the end with both nest box concept flaws and a complete miss as for use with the Vsion cage, it is not a good investment and I will not recommend the product or purchase another.

Unfortunately, it is not as effective but my dog has improved with training with a regular choke collar enough so that I use this one now.  You feel the pull but it's a more humane compromise.  My sister recommended it because her dog is an escape artist.  Apparently it is works for that problem:  dogs who can escape from their collar on a walk.  It is reflective and that's a nice touch.  Normally, my 45 pound border collie wears a medium size collar, but for this collar, I needed a large.  If you have a larger dog, try putting a string tied into a circle to see how much room you need to fit it over your dog's head.  That will give you the number of minimum inches of how large of a collar you need.  I don't recommend using the collar as the 24/7 collar, but just use on walks.  I would worry about choking if worn overnight and it gets caught and there is metal that touches the neck and that might cause discoloration or discomfort from metal on skin/fur.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "11 25, 2013", "summary": "Fits small.

Bison and Venison as the main 2 ingredients in the dog food! Not that Bison and Venison meat is any better, but it might help out dogs that has allergies to common meats such as Chicken, Beef and/or fish. Best part of it is that the price of the dog food costs the same as other flavors! A lot of dog foods meant for dogs with allergies usually tend to cost a lot more.2. Price per pound is very economical. Price is actually much cheaper than lower quality foods such as Eukanuba, Purina, etc. It isn't cheaper than Pedigree, but at the same time it isn't filled with garbage like Pedigree is.3. Dog likes the taste. A lot of my friends feed this to their dogs. I fed it to one of my dogs before. He likes it as much as he does for the fish flavor. My other dog doesn't but he doesn't like any kibble anyways, so it isn't this food's fault.4. Food quality is good. No by-products or corn or any other garbage (like unknown sources of bone and meat meals, etc).5. No more ethoxyquin in any taste of the wild products!6. Solid poop with no disgusting smells!Cons:1. Dogs seem to poop more on this food than other brands such as Orijen or Wellness. Not a lot more though so this isn't really a biggie.2. Made by diamond Pet foods. Not really a biggie either, but diamond pet foods had been plagued with pet recalls problems in the past. Taste of the Wild hasn't had any recalls that I know of, but you're still running a risk, just a really small one.Compared to other brands, this is probably 4 out of 5, but it would be unfair because this brand is much cheaper.

My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2008", "summary": "Almost worthy of five stars"}

He was a finicky drinker, and if the water was more than 12 hours old, he wouldn't drink it. Back then, there were very few places that sold this fountain and it was expensive. I ordered it from a Drs. Foster and Smith catalog, and I seem to remember it cost more than $70 after shipping, which was a lot to a poor college student. But I thought it would be cheaper than vet bills and if anything would stop Dragon's painful urinary problems, I would try it (I also changed his to a non-seafood based food, which helped). Long story short, he and his brother both loved it, he never had another kidney related vet appointment again, and he died at the ripe old age of 14 from natural causes. This same fountain is now living on through another generation of cats who also love it, and it just keeps on pumping. I admit I am not the most diligent about cleaning it. It gets a rinse once a month and a full breakdown cleaning in the dishwasher (with the pump removed and the clear pastic reservior handwashed) every two months or so. I change the filter once per month. I've never had to replace a single part, even the pump. It's all original 1997 vintage parts, doesn't even look like the new version anymore, no logo or anything. :) My DH says it looks ugly from the limescale build-up around the bowl that will NOT come off (we have hard water) and he suggested we buy one of those fancy-schmancy bubbly dome ones for our ridiculously pampered kitties.

If you have a preference for clay and clumping litters, you can't do better than this. If you use an automated litter box, like the litter maid brands, you should really consider switching over because this litter is going to hold up so much better to that mechanical arm than other brands. Even if you don't have one of those, and you use clay based litters, you should still switch over right away!Cleaning out litter, which is always the least pleasant part of owning an indoor cat, was made so much easier when we made the switch to Dr. Elsey's. Now, there's no need to worry about clumps breaking as you're scooping or inhaling litter dust as you clean out the kitty's box. The low dust baseline is also excellent for your cat, and a must if you have a kitty with respiratory problems. This is an unscented, clay litter which is great, as it wont turn off cats from using it (due to their much more highly developed sense of smell, cats are often offended by scented litters). If you did want something to absorb the odors a bit better, you could always sprinkle a little bit of baking soda on the litter after you clean it out and add more.So now, what used to take so much time because you had to be so incredibly careful in scooping, lest you break up clumps, cleans up in just a minute or two. This litter's also cut back drastically on how often I need to toss out the entire box of litter, saving on money. Because the clumps don't break up, there's no real residue or broken, stray pieces dirtying up the remaining litter. As a result, the litter really doesn't need to be changed all the frequently. From what used to be a weekly thing, now it's a once a month chore. And if you're really diligent about regular, daily box cleanup, and maintain a sufficient height of litter (~3.5-4 inches) you could probably even get away with not tossing it ever (see amazing online articles on litter and litter boxes by Vet, Lisa A. Pierson on catinfo.org).I've also noticed less tracking, I think because it's such a dense litter, though some still occurs. I think that's just the nature of clumping litter though and easily addressed with a good mat or tray in front of the litter box entrance.Honestly, there's not enough good things to say about this litter. I've found it to be great for my cats and the foster home my last kitty came from also used this brand and they had some 10 cats living there. They swore by this litter and couldn't rave enough about it. I strongly recommend switching, if you're even slightly considering it!

My cat had no problem with this set-up.  I, however, could not stand the constant sweeping of litter that would be tracked all over my hardwoods, even with the various mats I placed outside the box.  Two years ago, I decided to look at other boxes on Amazon, and the good reviews drew me to the Breeze.  For a month, I attempted to allow my cat to transition on her own by placing the Breeze box beside her regular box.  She refused to use the Breeze, until I finally decided to take my chances, and I took her old box away.  Success!**Breeze vs. Old box/clumping litter**Pros:* Very little tracking of litter!  A few stray pellets may escape, but nothing compared to the old clumping litter.* Seems more environmentally friendly, especially for the cat, as these pellets create very little dust.Cons:* More expensive.  I keep the cost down by mixing Breeze pellets with Fresh Pine pellets.* Can be messy if you don't use it properly.  For me, the biggest thing was to ensure I laid the pad in the tray \"just so.\"  She liked to pee towards the front of the box, so if there was even a slight shift of the pad, it would not absorb, and the tray would be filled with urine.  If you remove the tray for any reason, aside from changing the pad, make certain the pad is still placed correctly before you slide the tray back, as it may have shifted.  It's recommended you change the pad once a week for a one cat home, and this worked for me.Final note - I do have concerns about how sanitary Breeze is, if I was to follow Breeze's recommendations.  One month seems a long time to go without changing the pellets.  I know the pee is absorbed underneath on the pad, but some must be absorbed by the pellets, and I don't like the idea of my cats having to stand in that for a month.  With the recent passing of my 16 year old cat, I've adopted two kittens, and I've got them using Breeze.  I'm planning to do some research for tips on how to keep the box really clean, as well as practical expected usage for the pellets.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2012", "summary": "Solved issues with tracking of litter.

They contain calcium but beyond that there's not much there.  The calcium is way down on the ingredient list, preceded by beef hide, starches and a sugar, so the calcium may be trace amounts.  The package analysis lists it at 1.38% minimum.  So essentially, the product is mostly filler.Before anyone says \"But FunBites is loaded with protein\"....The package lists crude protein as 53%.  Keep in mind manufacturers know what our eyes see on a label, which is PROTEIN.  Yes, but crude protein is simply the amount of protein found in the foods, and doesn't' signify that it is quality protein that is of any value to your dog.  So unless you see ingredients which list \"meat\" or \"meal\" after their name (example \"chicken meal\"), the crude protein is simply a number.These are made in Mexico, if you are concerned about buying food/products from outside the U.S. or specific countries.I think the one benefit to FunBites is their shape, being flat.  We have a 5 month old Golden Retriever puppy.  Like most puppies, he's going through his teething stage.  He is chewing on most everything and his new teeth are coming in.  He has a good assortment of chew toys, including some soft, some hard, cold ones, etc.  One thing he has shied away from is rawhide products.  Even if we get something filled, or fillable with his favorite snacks like peanut butter, he pays them little mind.  We figured he just didn't like them, or perhaps it was his teeth making it painful to gnaw on the rawhide.So we tried FunBites Calcibone.  He really likes them.  He will chew on them for a bit, eat them right up and wag his tail for more.So for us, they fit the bill as an occasional treat.  They are hard enough to hopefully give him a little cleaning benefit (but always brush their teeth!) yet small enough for him to manage, unlike larger or rounder rawhide products. These are not our main treat, as we prefer other products that are more beneficial nutritionally.  So we just use them on occasion as small rewards,  They can also be broken in half or smaller, so you can stretch these a long way.Price-wise they are not bad at all, then again there is little to them in the way of ingredients, so the value is in the volume of treats not in the overall quality.

The suction power isn't good at all and the thing only works when the water level is exactly right. The cheap version without a motor or need for batteries works so much better at removing things from the tank.  And when you clean the tank you should change the water anyway.  The only plus to this is you don't lose the water when you are cleaning the gravel.  The minus is you have to have the water at just the right depth to get the thing to work at all, and then the suction isn't strong enough to move much.  This thing just managed to stir things up in the tank and make it look terrible.In my little tanks 5gal, 6gal, this is almost a worthless item, in the new 29gal tank it works wonders.  with more water its easy to get the water flowing, and keep it flowing, and with a larger tank the gravel cleaning attachment works allot like a comb as you move it around your tank because the large grooves in the side of the head don't allow real suction to get going.  If you take the head off this thing is full of suctions power and you have to be careful not to allow gravel to get into the impeller.In a larger tank it does what its supposed to do, and when I emptied my smaller tanks it worked pretty well and filtering the debris out of the water and moving it into a bucket for reuse in the bigger tank.  There is a strange little stream of water that shoots out of it below the filter sock though. It doesn't make much sense to me to leave a way for stuff to just flow right back into the tank without running through the filter.It also does quit well at when you attach a hose to it, at removing water from  a tank. the water comes out quite quickly, for this use I was impressed, I just wish they hadn't cut the huge groves in the gravel head so I could do what it was make for, maybe they have two and half inches of gravel in their tanks, but I don't have enough gravel to make the grooves sense.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2013", "summary": "works but not well"}

If you want to give your dog healthy organic treats that they'll like, these treats are it.These treats are about 2 inches by 1 inch, scored in the middle so that you can break them in half (even scored, it can be difficult to break them in half). These treats are very hard - so if you have a dog with dental problems (like a senior dog), they will have problems eating these treats. If you have a dog that leaves crumbs and doesn't vacuum the floor for every morsel, you'll find plenty of crumbs after your dog eats these treats.Taste-wise, my dogs loved these treats. I have 2 large dogs (Labs) who, granted, love all treats. I decided to try a taste test - since my dogs will eat their favorite treat first, I was curious to see how these treats fared with some of their other treats. I gave my dogs these treats, a lite doggie treat, and a bacon/cheddar treat (both of these treats are made by Old Mother Hubbard). Of the three times I tried this test, one Lab consistently preferred the Old Mother Hubbard (OMH) bacon/cheddar treat (and would eat this treat a quick second), the other Lab preferred the Newman's Own treats. Considering that the Lab who ate the OMH treats first, tried to eat these at almost the same time, I'll say he liked these treats a lot too.For the amount of treats and with Amazon's current price, I think this is great deal for a healthy doggie treat.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2011", "summary": "My dogs loved them"}

Sludge, slim and dirt collects and forms too fast making it not worth the cleaning effort compared to just using a stainless steel bowl. I may try a Ceramic Pet Fountain, I know they have stainless steel fountains as well.The positive points: Cats seem to enjoy it. You don't have to change out the water in the bowl as frequently as a still standing bowl. It has a filter to filter out the crud that collects in the bowl. It fits together nicely and doesn't use too much space. It does make a bit of a splashing noise when the cats drink and / or if you have the pump set to a certain flow. It isn't bad IMO, its actually relaxing to me.The negative points: You'll have to clean it once every 1-2 weeks, and it can be a bit of a pain. (There are a lot of parts to clean.) You have to set aside 10-15 minutes to clean it. If you use filtered water, the water tends to stay clean longer. Sludge will eventually form regardless. The pump causes vibrations and some of the plastic parts rattle. I usually just hit the top of it and it stops when it does that. When the pump is on high, water runs over the top of the internal filter. (Defeating its purpose.) So you cant really have it on high unless the filter is brand new. I think the internal filter design sucks but it works. Kinda.Overall, im pleased with it and recommend it. I think there could be some improvements but it is defiantly better then having a regular still standing plastic water bowl. If you pass on getting one of these water fountains, I would use a stainless steel bowl.

My current foster dog has a severe case of Malassezia yeast and Pseudomonas in both ears and a generalized yeast skin infection. The smell is horrendous so I can appreciate the odor control ingredients in this product. The ingredients help break up the bio-film that Pseudomonas forms in the ear and this is absolutely necessary for any medication to work.

I DID get my senior kitty to use it. It took a little more prompting. I had to both have her get used to a ramp from the couch to the floor (she gained confidence using that one, and eventually realized that there was a pretty similar ramp up to the Litter Robot), as well as change her alternate litter box to a cheap covered one - cost me $9.99 and is here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ASCGC/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1. I kept it uncovered at first, then a few days later, covered it. I kept taping the lid of the covered one up (although it kept falling down). I think eventually the litter in there got dirty enough and the cover trapped in the smell enough that she saw the Litter Robot as a cleaner, better option. She and the younger cat have been fighting over the Litter Robot - the younger one got used to it being part of &#34;his&#34; turf. I did add more catnip to the litter (inside) as well as spray catnip spray around the 'bot, and used only Cat Attract litter for the 'bot (I used World's Best for the cheap covered box - which the Litter Robot people don't recommend using, btw.) For several days, I also put the globe on the floor. I stabilized it (somewhat) with the cardboard packaging material it came with (a few pieces had circles cut out which fit the globe). My senior kitty got used to using it while it was on the floor, and then I put it up on the base again, with the ramp, after she was already used to a similar ramp doing something she was motivated to do (getting on and off the couch). It's a bit of effort and can be a pain while transitioning, but it's very much worth the effort!!!I also called the people at Litter Robot and they gave me great advice. I thought my circuit board in the front wasn't working and they shipped another out right away (Murphy's law, it seemed to work again the day after I called them.) It really is an incredible piece of machinery and if you can't get your cat to use it, I'd try calling Litter Robot for a few other ideas...their ideas helped get me to get my senior kitty using it, and I am THRILLED.12-29-2014:The Litter Robot is the best kitty litter solution available, IF your cat will use it. We have two cats - one is a senior, arthritic with previous injuries, the other young and agile. The young one became curious enough and I let the other cat litter in the regular litter boxes &#34;go&#34; long enough for him to realize this was a good place to do his business. He doesn't, however, like it. It still intimidates him (after all, it does look like the Death Star - it's even intimidating looking for us). I added a makeshift ramp to it (a ramp catscratcher and put catnip on the catscratcher), to help entice him. It worked. I would recommend that the makers offer some kind of ramp like solution.My senior kitty would not use it. Even though she was embarrassed and ashamed, she preferred to go outside the traditional litter boxes (once they were dirty enough) than to use the Litter Robot. I thought the ramp would help entice her, but since it is lightweight and not attached, I think she felt too insecure using it. The shelf offered on this machine is not enough for the older, senior, arthritic cat. She is not very agile and, while not intimidated by the machine itself, she is intimidated by her ability to actually use it (get in, turn around, do her business, get out without falling, etc.). I really wanted her to use this since she has to go through radioactive iodine treatment soon, for her hyperthyroidism, and I wanted to limit my exposure to handling her radioactive waste, after the treatment. Since I've had it out for a month and she has never touched it, I gave up and bought the LitterMaid as an additional backup litter solution. The LitterMaid is pretty terrible. We've had it all of a night and already the litter is stuck on the rake and the rake is putting more clean litter than dirty into the waste receptacle.The two modifications I would make to the Litter Robot, if I were at all mechanically inclined would be:1. A ramp offering for cats who aren't agile (there's tons and the company would be wise to think of the owners of those animals - usually the seniors are using the litter box a lot more frequently, so owners have a greater need for some litter box help).2. A way to disengage the top. While my senior likes her privacy, and normally wouldn't have an issue with the top, she has been &#34;caught&#34; in a few places in the past, by the younger cat, and now doesn't like a spot that doesn't have an escape route. It's well known that cats are more comfortable with litter boxes with no covers. I know that if I had a ramp that was sturdy and didn't move, as well as a temporary period where I could take the top off, my senior cat would be using this as well.I'm keeping this as my younger cat *sometimes* uses it (he doesn't often - he'll use the alternatives if clean enough - he's still scared of the thing), so that helps. But it is a lot of money to shell out for a &#34;sometimes&#34;. I'm hoping that he gets more in the habit.If you have perfectly &#34;normal&#34; cats (I don't, both were rescues), then you'll probably have better luck than I've had. There is literally NO smell after the Robot has done its dirty work. You barely have to touch it (I only touch mine to turn the power on and off - so as to lessen the chances of freaking my cats out). And it doesn't spew litter everywhere, as one reviewer described. I do recommend spraying catnip spray on the outside, as well as adding some Cat Attract litter and catnip on the inside as well as on the lip and shelf. I also recommend purchasing a $16 incline cat scratcher ramp and sprinkling catnip all over that as well. It goes a little higher than the shelf, a little lower than the lip, but my younger cat has been using that.I also don't know what reviewers are complaining about as far as the noise goes. I live in a 750 sq foot house, with pergo floors, so ALL sounds travel, and I have sensitive hearing. I barely hear the litter robot from any other room. I guess any noise is too much for some people? It's not unbearable at all. Again, if this machine were modified, somewhat, for the older kitty or kitty with some body issues, it would be a home run. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is for that issue, otherwise it would be 10 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2014", "summary": "BEST Kitty Litter Solution Available"}

Again, it is a favorite.But...The two identical X-shaped holes for filling have little \"nubs\" in them to help keep treats/kibble from falling out too quickly.  That's great in theory, but not in practice.  The holes are so \"well-designed\" that they don't allow most treats/kibble to come out AT ALL.  This is frustrating to my dog, as I am sure it will be to most dogs.  Therefore, I made a modification to the ball... I clipped two of the \"nubs\" out of one side of the ball, so the kibble/treats come out much more easily on one side.  I didn't want to do this to both sides because I didn't want the toy to dump things TOO easily.  One side was enough!The ball is a little larger than a softball, which means it is a great size for big dogs.

It is used partially as a cheap protein source and a cheap filler.  Cats have no use for corn and cannot effectively digest it which can result in very stinky, large stools and some medical problems.  Corn is also a common allergen among cats.

For those of you who don't know what animal by-products are I'll fill you in.  Animal by-products are the beaks, feathers, hooves, intestines, bones, etc. (basically the inedible parts of an animal) all ground up and served up for your cat to eat.I don't believe this food to be terrible but at the same time it isn't great either.

Needless to say, they don't run around and play as much as they used to due to their age.  I saw this toy on the TV show \"My Cat from Hell\", so I decided to give it a try.The toy is very light weight - it consists of a short plastic handle which has a thin wire attached to it, and at the end of the wire is a small mouse made of sisal.  You (the person) are supposed to use the wand to wave the mouse around on the floor to simulate an actual mouse moving and the cat is supposed to chase and catch it.All three of my cats loved this toy!  My boy cat is a great mouser - he caught it very quickly and actually put it into his mouth and tried to walk away with the entire toy, so proud of his \"catch\".  Too funny.A few important notes...this is an INTERACTIVE toy, meaning, it is intended to be used during a play session with you and your cat.  Do NOT leave this laying around as a small child could choke on the mouse (it is very hard and small - only about 1 1/2 inches long).  Also, I have a dog and I do not leave it laying around as the dog would definitely choke on this, as well.  I keep it in a drawer and pull it out when it's time to play, always careful to put it away afterwards.Since my guys liked it so much, I just ordered some more of it for my aunt, mother, sister and uncle to give to their cats for Christmas.

This was really great as it helps redirect the dog with the part of the leash that attaches to the front.  I was not being dragged in the same way.  This doesn't cure that.  After much time and failures with softer, more humane products and methods, I found that the Sprenger training collar worked miraculously.  I bought this harness because I was thrilled to see that they had a free replacement up to two harnesses/leashes regardless of how and why it was destroyed.  About two weeks into having the harness, my pup that normally does not chew on anything but her toys, positioned herself just right and managed to chew through one of the straps.  When I called the manufacturing company for replacement, I found out that they only replace the damaged/cut strap, and send it back.  I could live with that, but I found that I would have to enclose $6 for return shipping, and pay to ship it there.  While this is not a horrible deal, one is still paying approximately 50% of the purchase price in shipping to have only the severed strap replaced while the company claims that it is a free replacement program.  I didn't care for the misrepresentation.  Thus, I didn't have it replaced with the same.  It is a very nice collar otherwise.

You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S; but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!Now on to my review...My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:Beef:Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)Moisture.........................82.0% (max)Ash.................................1.0% (max)Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)Taurine..........................0.07% (min)CALORIC VALUE:As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156Liver:Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)Moisture.........................83.0% (max)Ash.................................1.5% (max)Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)Taurine..........................0.07% (min)CALORIC VALUE:As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129Beef & Liver:Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)Moisture.........................82.0% (max)Ash.................................1.0% (max)Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)Taurine..........................0.07% (min)CALORIC VALUE:As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140Here's to Kitty's health!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2009", "summary": "Happy whiskers and two paws way up!"}

Last time I searched all of the options that were less than $300 had bad reviews (for the record this particular litter box was not on the market then). $300 for a cat litter box is way more than what we are willing to spend. The current price of this box at $106 is much more reasonable.When the box arrived we did the small amount of assembly required and read the directions. We decided not to leave our cats a second option and not to put any of the old used litter into this new box (as recommended). Our two cats have had several different litter boxes over the years (one is 8 and the other is about 11 years old). They are pretty good about going wherever we pour the litter. Within minutes of us replacing their old box with this new one our older cat was in there using it and checking it out. Several minutes later we heard it scooping. We were thrilled.We have now been using this litter box for about two weeks. With two cats it has to be emptied out daily, but now that is super easy to do. We have been reusing one of the bags that come with the box for the entire time. We just dump the mess out into the trash every morning. It literally takes seconds now and is so easy. It is much less strain on our back and knees than it used to be trying to scoop everything out ourselves. The cats seem to love it too. Before they would always be in the litter box moving the litter around trying to get around any clumps that were already in there. Now that is not an issue.The rake does not always get everything on the first pass, but it normally picks up the rest on the second time. I also want to address the noise. It claims to be &#34;Over 4 Times Quieter Operation than Another Leading Brand&#34;. I am not sure who the leading brand is and I have nothing to compare it to. It is not super loud, however it is noticeable. In our house the litter box is in the laundry room which is off of the living room. When the television is off, you definitely hear it. It isn't distracting or super loud though. For us it blends in with the noise of our refrigerator making ice in the kitchen and the air-conditioner running. If it was in a bathroom off of our bedroom it may disturb my sleep. This is something to keep in mind depending on where your litter box is located.The box is also a little on the larger size. It works out fine for us since we have a large area with carpet that we place it on, but it is something to consider.This Pet Zone Smart Scoop Automatic litter box does use regular cat litter (which I love!). It has two lines - a minimum and maximum fill line to use as guides for the cat litter. I love this because it shows how much we overfilled our litter box before. We will definitely be saving on litter now.This litter box has definitely made our lives easier and made our house smell better. If this one breaks, we will probably buy another one. I definitely recommend this litter box.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2014", "summary": "Our cats love it and we love it even more!"}

The only thing we weren't expecting: a serious case of separation anxiety. After digging a hole to China in our apartment, howling for hours on end & later having to fork over a few hundred dollars for a trainer, I was feeling really demoralized because we weren't making much progress. Several people had asked if I had tried a stuffed Kong. I had always wondered what the draw was with them (our family dogs never gave them a 2nd glance) so I hadn't even thought about it for Smokey. After reading a few reviews online & checking out blogs on separation anxiety, I purchased the large Kong & figured I'd give it a shot.A few of the blogs I had read recommended stuffing it with delicious treats like steak or cheese on the bottom, then kibbles & sealing it up with cream cheese or Kong spray & freezing it. I tried this & settled Smokey in his kennel with the door open, gave him the Kong which he went BANANAS for & then made a big production of leaving -- jiggled keys, got my purse, opened the door: nothing. He didn't even look up at me. Mind you, this is the same dog who would cry when I would close the door to go to the bathroom.After practicing in different rooms, for different lengths of time, I FINALLY felt like there was a light at the end of tunnel. We actually bought extra Kongs so we could always have one ready to go in the freezer. Smokey is so excited for his Kong that when I get it from the freezer, he'll go racing to his kennel & hop right inside waiting for it. We've also made it a fast rule that he only gets the Kong when we leave & can only eat it in his kennel. The one time we forgot to get the Kong from the kennel upon returning home, I found him later that day in his kennel working on the rest of it.The separation anxiety is still a work in progress, but without the Kong, we couldn't even leave the house without him starting to howl. Now we can leave for up to 3-4 hours (and making progress week by week!) I'd definitely encourage freezing it & as your dog gets more familiar with it, add water or chicken broth to the kibbles to make it even harder to get out. Smokey can now clear a frozen Kong in an hour or less so we're working on perfecting more tricky methods!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2012", "summary": "Life saver with separation anxiety"}

Ever since the melamine introduction into pet foods I&#8217;m extremely cautious about what I feed my animals.  I check out ingredients zealously and have, at times, run things by my veterinarian.  I long ago shifted to products made in the United States, but did my research on Bully Sticks and grass-fed raised beef from Brazil are on the acceptable list.There are no hidden ingredients or strange herbal concoctions hidden inside the Bully sticks.  I have had some trouble with my small dog and herbs.  These have one ingredient and that&#8217;s dried pizzle.  Look that one up.  Even people have been known to eat them for medicinal purposes, but I think I&#8217;ll take a pass.My neighbor&#8217;s dog Bub, a German Shepherd adored the Bully sticks.  Even with his big teeth it did take him a bit to eat one.  They aren&#8217;t totally odor-free, but do have a very light scent when I opened the bag.  And it wasn&#8217;t anything in the chemical line.  You seriously get what you pay for these days and if you want a decent chew, Bully Sticks will fit the bill.FEATURES:&#9658;  Virtually Odor-Free&#9658;  Free of harsh chemicals such as bleach or formaldehyde&#9658;  All Natural and Fully Digestible&#9658;  100% Free-Range, Grass-Fed South American Beef (Brazil)&#9658;  Great Dental Chews&#9658;  USDA certified and inspected&#9658; Single-ingredient dog chewsI cringe when people use cowhide anything because it unravels and sits in the gut.  The Bully Sticks, on the other hand, are purportedly digestible.  I had no complaints about loose stools or a trip to the vet.  If you have a dog who literally wolfs treats and foods down in about one gulp, you should take a pass on everything, including Bully Sticks.  My dear departed Brandy would gulp stuff down as if she were imbibing a shot.The Bully Sticks are a one-a-day keep the dentist away sort of treat and the gnawing Bub proved that.  You can keep them in the freezer to extend the life of the sticks.  Insects love them as much as dogs do so make sure you keep the Ziplock-like enclosure zipped up for good measure.  FYI, there&#8217;s a two-year shelf life for these (I did my homework).Low fat, high protein, chem-free, good for the teeth, and on and on.  Sounds like something that&#8217;s good for a human diet and probably is.  Most people consider their animals to be full-fledged members of their households and only provide the best, something that Bully Sticks are.Sample provided for review.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2014", "summary": "High-quality treats for the valued members of our households ..."}

I had it down to Wolf Pup, Taste of Wild, and this Wellness Core.  WC was my last choice as I researched that some dogs can be allergic to chicken.  I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving.  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the \"other brand\" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The \"other brand\" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of \"other brand\" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back.Update:  She is now 9 weeks old and only needing a bath once a week.  She no longer has that \"dog smell\".  It has to be the food. :)2nd Update: 16 months now.  The only \"shed\" she had was when she lost her initial puppy fur about a year ago (and when she had a rash under her armpits).  We will still get hair off when she's brushed, but NO tumble weeds around the house like with our last dog who was on cheap Wal-Mart food.

If color is important to you, then you'll like that the company makes this in a variety of colors and patterns.  And this model features the rope-style (and not flat line) leash.  I don't personally have a preference -- my other leash is flat and German made -- but I know some people prefer this style.Now theoretically retractable leashes should be used in training dogs to come-when-called or other similar activities.  But we all know people who use them just to walk their dog.  I use this type of leash like that, to give my pup some room to stop and sniff for a second on our longer walks.  (I know she's supposed to be at my side, but alas I'm a bad and indulgent fur-mom.)For this kind of walk the Small Avant Garde leash is fine.  And in fact it would be inappropriate for the other sort of training because it's only 9 feet long.  The other characteristics of this leash that you might want to know about before choosing is that the 'pull' is harder than on other leashes.  My own pup can sense when I'm walking on and we're nearing the end of the rope, as it were, but other dogs may not be as sensitive, so if you use a 'choke collar' you might like this leash because it gives it's signal more distinctively than some brands.  And let me clarify that it's not an outrageous pull or anything.  My little Jackabee weights 10 pounds and isn't tugged around or anything.  I'm talking about a subtle effect.The only negative I could find to mention is that the handle is really small.  And perhaps when the company designated the leash as 'small' they meant that it was for children and not adults.  The handle does fit my 9 year-old son's hand perfectly, while I can only get 3 of my mom-sized fingers inside the grip.There product's page says there is one year warranty which is nice given the price, but I don't remember seeing anyway of registering for it.  (If it is there and I somehow missed it, I'm sure someone will shortly put me to task.)A nice leash.Pam T~December 28th UPDATE:::  Darn if my pooch didn't gnaw through the lead.

When I had read the initial reviews I was weary that the raindrop design might be too light and it wasn't until months later when I actually saw it in the store that I found that wouldn't be the case. I am trying to \"reclaim\" my house from my adopted puppy a little (wooden crate, getting floors cleaned, etc) and replacing the big, stainless steel bowl (it's BIG!) in my living room would be helpful!A few thoughts on the bowl itself - First, I went with stainless because it seemed like overall it would be the safest purchase. (Ceramics have glazing on them, which can leech into the water)I noticed within a few days, however, that there is definitely some \"muck\" on the bottom of the fountain.While cleaning it is easy it does take a few minutes...and once I have dumped all of the water it seems pointless NOT to stop and clean it. So I suppose if you are using this with a single dog (like me) where they are not going to be drinking all of the water in the bowl I would recommend dumping the water once every few days to prevent that muck. Even with a brand new filter it didn't appear to help much.It also seems to me like the motor is almost too weak. I have taken it apart during cleanings several times to double-check that I have it on the highest setting because the amount of force pushing the water up the fountain is very little. It makes sense that there is \"muck\" on the bottom because the force of the pump isn't enough to actually circulate all the water. (Which I thought was the whole point of the fountain.....) Also, a word to the wise when I first tore open the box and tried putting it together I actually thought the pump was broken because I could hear it moving but there was no water coming up.I kept repositioning it (everything has to actually match up to work) it until it finally did pump hard enough to push the water all the way through. Perhaps it WAS actually broken or damaged and I didn't realize it - either way, it still works overall and my dog still drinks out of it. (Except when it's been sitting for too long without being replaced) I do use filtered water with it (which makes the whole process take longer since my water filter jug doesn't have the capacity of the fountain)Other than these mentioned items it's a good product - it's very sturdy (although the top piece could potentially be tipped over, but I think that could be said of most standard bowls) and holds a LOT of water. I suppose they mean it when they say \"Big Max!\" I finally decided to bite the bullet and replace this after a few months of use with the ceramic teardrop version. My dog seems to prefer ceramic anyway and she LIKES little bowls. (She's a boxer-rottie mix, a medium sized dog overall) who seems to not know her own size! I bought it used through Amazon because I couldn't cough up another $50 on this fountain.I'm hoping the ceramic teardrop design pleases me aesthetically more than t his one does! Hopefully I can sell this one used on EBay or something to try and recoup my losses.

We shouldn't have worried-- both cats took to the litterbox  just fine and actually use it more frequently than they did our previous litterbox.  For our cat with urinary problems, this is an added bonus since cats tend to develop urinary problems partly due to not using the box frequently enough.

It only takes him about a day to destroy them so they have to be a outside toy only. However I make an exception with this toy. He has had them for about 1 month now and it is holding up great. He likes to carry it around the house and squeak it. That is the one thing I don't like much. The squeaker is loud and high pitched. I have given the toy a timeout many times because my dog will squeak it for hours and it can grate on your nerves. The ball is easy to squeeze. I can squeeze this ball about 1/3 down with one hand. My dog can squeeze it till it is a 1/3 of the size. Keep in mind this thing squeaks. You can guess it is very loud when squeezed that far. Also because it is easy to squeeze dogs do not have to release it all the way so your dog can re squeek it before the first squeek is complete. Now keep this in mind if you are planning on getting one.The size is nice it is bigger then normal tennisballs about 3.5\". This is nice because it is easy to see in his mouth. Also it does not fix under my couch. I can not stress how great this is. My dog gets balls stuck under the couch and then starts stressing over it. He will lay on the floor looking at the ball and bark for someone to get it out this can get very annoying. So large size is great.I have not had a problem with him chewing off the yellow part on this toy like some people said, but he has done this on other balls.

The brush wasn't getting down deep enough, and the bristles just wouldn't trap the hair. Despite being marketed as a &#34;cat brush,&#34; it was more like a regular hairbrush. Cleaning the brush was also a struggle; we would have to use a comb to try to rake the hair out of it, never very successfully. So it was always clogged, reducing its effectiveness even more.This brush by Four Paws has rows of thin, sharp filaments with a bend in the end which helps trap the hair in the brush. It looks sharp and painful, but trust me, it isn't. Our cat loves it, and will actually roll around in different positions to be sure we don't miss a spot! I am stunned how much cat hair this brush removes with each use-- literally a handful every time. It glides effortlessly through her thick fur with never a snarl or snag, getting deep down where our other brush never reached. And the brush is very easy to clean; the hair virtually lifts right off the brush in a little mat that you just throw away and, voila, clean brush.Brushing our cat has become a pleasure.

He has never had terrible leash manners or any significant dominance issues, but as I've recently brought in a German Shepherd pup to my house, I've decided it was time to crack down and remove all of the remaining minor dominant tendencies from him so he sets a proper example for the growing puppy.I took my Boxer on his first walk with the Illusion collar last night and was almost instantly convinced that it will be a great help.  My Boxer was completely unable to tug on his leash even when we passed other dogs (which is usually the point that he gets a bit excited and wants to meet them).  After about five minutes, he was walking properly (ears back, head down a bit) most of the time.By the end of the walk, he wasn't even raising his head much when we passed other people.  When he did, I issues a quick tug and correction, and he resumed the submissive position.  It was pretty amazing how easy it was to correct him with this collar opposed to any others he's ever worn.To be fair, this collar isn't some high tech piece of technology.  You still have to be assertive to your dog and offer tugs and corrections when he does something he shouldn't.  This collar simply makes it significantly easier to control a large dog and offer corrections that actually get through to him.The only downside to this collar is that it is pretty overpriced for what you get (hence the four stars).  All it is is a couple of adjustible straps that hold up the actual collar portion of the thing.  It probably costs less than two bucks to make and they're charging fifty.  Twenty-five to thirty bucks would be a much more reasonable price for this collar.Still, it works and it works well, so it's hard to complain about too much.  I'll definitely be buying a second one for my Shepherd when he's big enough and has a strong enough neck to wear it.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2012", "summary": "Convinced After One Walk"}

As a chew toy, this kong ring does NOT live up to the durability of the kong name. The squeaking function and toy itself can be destroyed in a matter of hours (or even less) if your dog really goes at it.The reason I still love this toy, however, is that it is one of the most fun and unique toys to play fetch with! If you hold it perpendicular to how you would hold a frisbee and throw/roll it on the ground it bounces and rolls extremely far. Using this technique and really hurling it at the ground, I can make this toy go much further than a tennis ball. My lab absolutely loves to chase it because the toy bounces up with every little bump in the ground and it takes a little more strategy to fetch than a tennis ball.I have bought 2 of these (medium and large) because my lab loves to fetch it so much. Every time I take it to the dog park and start throwing it, people ask me what kind of toy it is and comment on how fun it looks. My dog carries it around and acts like he's the coolest kid on the playground.The first one lasted several months (I wouldn't let him lay down and just chew on it, it was for fetch only), and my second one lasted 2 months. The weak point in the toy are the two seams where the two halves of the donut fits together. This seam is held together with an adhesive that is prone to weakening in heat (don't leave it in the hot sun or in a hot car all day long). In fact the toy itself warps considerably when left in a hot car all day long. One of mine broke apart at the seam after a couple of weeks and I super glued it back together (this made it last another month and a half).I debated giving this less than 5 stars because it has some very obvious flaws, but I just couldn't because my lab loved it so much and for 10 bucks it was well worth it for me. I will be buying another one.The squeaking is loud until it stops working, which happened quickly on both of mine even though I only used it for fetch.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2012", "summary": "Great toy for &#34;fetch&#34;"}

When we first got him, both my husband and I would keep sneezing like crazy. Neither of us were ever allergic to dogs or cats when being around them before, but neither of had ever had an indoor cat before. We were so worried that we were allergic to him because the only option was for him to go back to the shelter. We did some research and found out most people are actually allergic to the dander or litter. Thankfully for us, it was the LITTER! We tried Feline Pine and the sneezing stopped YAY! I feel good knowing that our kitty isn't licking up or breathing in chemicals when he cleans himself or uses the litter. I didn't give this product 5 Stars because it is NOT \"self cleaning\" as I've seen it advertised before. The dust doesn't simply fall to the bottom tray - you have to scoop the poops, then sift the box quite a bit so ALL the dust falls to the bottom tray. It is very good about urine smells- It just smells like pine, but it doesn't cover the smell of poops. To be fair though, our cat is rather stinky. Even the old litter with deodorants etc didn't cover his stink- he has a clean bill of health from the Vet but he is stinkier that any of my friends cats.Also, FP DOES track. Especially if you don't sift out the dust entirely. We find whole pellets around the house sometimes. I imagine kitty kicks them out of the box then they get elsewhere.HOWEVER - I believe we have found a solution to that pellet problem. The only litter box we could find for this litter was uncovered (Box from the FP website). Just today, I went to Walmart and got a cheap $5 large plastic container, then cut a \"door\" in it being careful not to leave any sharp edges. PRESTO that container fit like a glove around the FP litter box.

I had completely tightened everywhere I could and it hung off of her.  My husband was supposed to return it but never did so I ordered the \"small\" figuring we'd have better results.The size discrepancy between the two sizes was ridiculous!  The small was so tiny even fully extended for it's full size that it wouldn't even go half way around her chest area.  We still had the medium to compare it too.  As it had been awhile since we bought the medium and she had grown a bit more we tried it on our dog again and although still big it wasn't as loose as it had been but it still did not fit tightly as the instructions told you to adjust it.  It was quite loose around both her back and around the front and the only part that we could adjust it enough so it was fitted right was around her belly area.  I ended up gathering up some of it across her back and sewing a few stitches in it to get it to be as snug as the directions indicated.Although the front was still a bit loose we decided to give it a try and took her out for her walk. Seemed to make the walks much better as she was still pulling but not as much as she had been and the walks were much easier with her being much easier to control.  So that was a few days ago. Went to put the harness on her today and noticed that the part of the harness where you attach the leash the material there had split halfway through and if I hadn't noticed it I'm sure it would have ripped the rest of the way and my puppy would have been loose. Glad I noticed because we not only live on a busy street we live in a heavily wooded area with a marsh in the back and lots of coyotes and we never want her to be off her leash for fear she could get hit by a car or disappear into the woods.So definitely a one star for me, product does seem to work but the discrepancy from the small to medium makes it impossible to find a size that will fit properly and the fact that it was in danger of breaking all the way through after just a few outings is really bad.  I did sew up the tear and will continue to use it but will be checking it constantly to make sure it hasn't started to rip through again.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2012", "summary": "Problems with sizing and broke after a few uses."}

She can pull with the best and instantly becomes a sled dog when fitted with a regular harness. I researched no-pull harnesses for days and decided on this one based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Now I have used the harness regularly for over a week, I cannot give it more than 3 stars - here's why:(1) Annoying to fit. I knew this before I bought it, but seriously, I spent a good hour trying to fit it just perfectly.(2) The straps get loose after you use it one to two times, so you have to refit the harness often.(3) The harness decreases pulling but does not make my dog walk like an angel by any means. (side note: we are going to puppy classes which has helped somewhat.) The first times she lunged at a couple other dogs, she fell on her face, flipped over, and kept tripping on the leash. While I suppose that could deter her from lunging, it was an unpleasant experience. The other dog owners were questioning why I was letting her be so destructive to herself, but I really had no control over it. She was in the zone where no amount of food or instruction would help. She does not pull to this extreme anymore, but she knows just how much she can pull without getting into that sort of trouble.(4) Probably the most disappointing of it all - CHAFFING. It was my fault that I continued to use the harness after I thought I noticed it was making her belly/armpits lose hair, but I honestly wasn't sure. She didn't seem to hurt or be bothered by the harness and she has pretty short, thin hair on her chest/armpits/belly. Then yesterday evening, after a number of long walks and going to puppy training class, I noticed she had quarter-sized raw areas under her armpits! I was horrified! This apparently is a common problem with this harness.I like that this harness did discourage lunging and pulling hard, as compared to my other traditional harness which seemed to encourage pulling...

I guess time will tell how long before I develop a problem, but I'm lucky enough to be using this in a vacuum system (where the CO2 is being pulled from the tank via venturi into a pump) so there's no pressure in the lines which is definitely helping in this situation.  I would imagine if it were pressurized (tank to ceramic diffuser for example) I would have thrown it out far sooner as CO2 would be escaping from the hairline crack.Also the mount is cheesy, it just kind of pushes together like a single lego block.  With any kind of force which your CO2 lines will inevitably give you'll soon be ready to super glue the little tab in for life.Other than all that negative it is easy to see and count bubbles...if it'll stay working for long enough.

The pup gets this when chores need to be done around the house that require both hands (dishes, gardening, cooking) so he's not constantly getting underfoot.

I've been using it for about 2 months now, and it works great! My cat is about 1 year old and previously used the smaller Booda dome as a litter box so transition was not that difficult. The Litter Robot actually seems to have more space inside than the Booda dome, so I think any cat transitioning from a similar covered litter box would also have minimal problems. I left the Litter Robot off for 2 days while she got used to it, only turning it on twice a day to let it cycle. After the third day, I left it on and cleaned up the old litter box. My cat has been using it ever since.I had a few issues to start but they are all dealt with now. First, my cat was leaping into and out of the Litter Robot. This caused it to not cycle since pressure on the step into the Litter Robot is required to set the cycling timer. I solved this by turning the Litter Robot to face a corner so that my cat had no choice but to use the step to enter.My cat is also a kicker. I found a lot of litter outside the Litter Robot from where she kicked it out while using the litter box. To fix this, I purchased the Litter Robot fence and lip extender for $24 ([...]). The lip extender is required for the Litter Robot fence to work. I want to note that my version of the Litter Robot seems to be the original (there isn't a number so it doesn't look like it's a LRII), but the lip extender/fence will fit it. I know some people posted that they have problems with cats that don't turn around, causing urine to splatter all over the step. I guess the lip extender would fix that, but my cat has never had that issue.There is a smell...if you stick your face right in front of it (but what did you expect??). About a few weeks in, I did notice that I kept getting wafts of an unpleasant smell in my room. I live in a 1 bedroom apartment, and the Litter Robot would not fit anywhere convenient so it is in my living room. I realized that the smell was most likely due to me moving my air purifier away (normally it sits between my desk and the litter box) because I was rearranging some things. I moved it back, purchasedAPI Ammo-Carb, Half Gallon Carton, Net Weight 37-Ounce, and plugged in an air freshener. Since then, I've had no problems. I don't even know if the Ammo-Carb is necessary, but I put some in the waste drawer in the liner (which I change every month) and in the trash bag (which I change once a week).I am using 13 gallon kitchen trash bags in the waste drawer. This is fine for one cat - but it's not big enough if you find yourself having to sweep a lot of litter over the step. The step deposits into the drawer but it's very difficult for you to make sure it actually lands in whatever you have lining it. I haven't had any issue with sweeping litter off the step since I installed the litter fence.Finally, I used this with 2 types of litter. Initially, I usedPrecious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter, 40 pound bagwhich worked fine. I switched from this litter because I read that the dust from clay clumping litter is not good for your cat. Now I useSwheat Scoop Multi Cat Natural Wheat Cat Litter, 25 Pound Bagwhich also works fine. The only issue I noticed with Swheat Scoop is that it smells much stronger (more acrid maybe?) when you empty the waste drawer. But I still can't smell it with my current setup.In summary - I very much recommend the Litter Robot. It's extremely pricey (I am lucky I got it heavily discounted), but I think I would probably purchase it at full price after trying it.Edit: After using Swheat Scoop for a month, I'm switching back to the Precious Cat litter. Swheat Scoop just doesn't work as well in the Litter Robot - it tends to create a sticking layer to the rubber interior that requires prodding to get rid of during a cycle. I've come to terms with the potential hazards of clay litter (there are no scientific studies, Precious Cat is extremely low dust, and my cat does not eat litter).Edit again: If you are using an air purifier nearby, the Ammo Carb and air freshener aren't even necessary.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2012", "summary": "Litter Robot accessories may fix your issues"}

I believe it is important to have this larger size because dogs move around when they are pooping, at least mine do. With the larger pad there is less chance of missing and hitting the floor. Also, I have found that the pad holder having the edging around it seems to keep the dogs inside the holder when they poop and pee.  When I had the pads on the ground not only did they get moved around and bunched up at times but there were many 'misses' as they wandered off onto the floor at times.Everyone with a dog should own at least one of these.  I always hated to leave the dogs home alone to have to wait  for me to take them out when I got home, in the \"old days\".  I also don't like being woken up for \"potty time\".  I imagine it is painful for them to hold it for very long when they have to go and no need for them to have to do that with these potty pads.  Not to mention it saves your flooring if they can't hold lt.  I think crating them for long periods so they won't soil the floor is cruel too.  I used the pads for years, so was very happy to find the holder.  It makes sit so much easier. This one is easy to clean and use. Each end lifts up and down to replace the pads.  It is very sturdy plastic. A small price to pay for the added benefits in using doggy pads. I am going to order another one for the downstairs area.I like the larger potty pads made to fit this the best but have found it is more economical to buy the small ones by the 100 and use two at a time. Using two works because the holder around the edges  keeps them down so they don't get all bunched up. I prefer the Iris brand as they are just better. The urine does not seem to spread out as much.  I buy the other at the store now and then, but these are superior.Do yourself and your dog a favor, start them as puppies using this and you will never have the problem of having to clean your floors and carpet so often.  It saves soooooo much time and expense.  My older dogs learned to use them too but it is just easier to start them off this way in the beginning. That way you can keep your dog in the house where they are so much safer. In our area I don't leave my dogs outside as I have friends who have had their dogs stolen and they get out accidentally when someone leaves a gate open.  An Owl swooped down suddenly and took another friends precious little Yorkie while outside going potty and my friend was standing right next to it.

They don't fall all over themselves to get to the bowl, but they don't turn their noses up to it either. I usually add some sort of cooked meat or yogurt as a treat, so they are kind of spoiled.So I opened a bag of the Pro Plan Savor, Chicken flavor and they immediately seemed interested. They picked out most of the Pro Plan over the Kirkland brand food, which says a lot about the taste. However, the ingredients are still not up to snuff with Kirkland brand. Here are the ingredients below. The ones I take exception to (low quality fillers) have an asterisk.I really don't like the additional corn. If your dog gets ear infection easily. Check their dog food for corn. One of my dogs is allergic to corn and gets ear infections when she gets too much of this stuff in cheap dog food. I'm waiting to see if it causes problems.Also poultry by-products can be anything left over in the slaughter house--beaks, feet, bones, whatever. Gross.The chemical at the bottom, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity) is controversial and unnecessary.Ingredients: Chicken, brewers rice, *whole grain wheat, *corn gluten meal,poultry by-product meal (natural source of glucosamine), *soy flakes, *whole grain corn, *corn germ meal, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of vitamin E), barley, *soybean meal, dried egg product, fish meal (natural source of glucosamine), animal digest, glycerin, calcium phosphate, *wheat bran, fish oil, salt, potassium chloride, potassium citrate, calcium carbonate, zinc proteinate, vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, manganese proteinate, ferrous sulfate, sulfur, l-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), copper proteinate, niacin, vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, vitamin B12 supplement, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin supplement, calcium iodate, vitamin D3 supplement, *menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity), folic acid, biotin, sodium seleniteNone of these are in the Kirkland brand.

We are always looking for accessories that will make our trips easier on all of us, and not having to carry our pup's necessities was something that we both thought would be a good idea. I grew up around working alpine-rescue dogs, and always loved their little backpacks, many of which were custom-made by the Alpine Rescue Team simply because that sort of thing wasn't readily available. This backpack seemed absolutely perfect for our needs! As one of boycott boring's product testers (the distributor), I received the medium size backpack in exchange for an honest review.QUALITY/CONSTRUCTIONAs with all Outward Hound products, this backpack is VERY well made. Constructed from what I believe is very durable nylon (think hiking backpack), it is absolutely up to the task of any rough and tumble that can happen while out on hikes/at the dog park, and comes clean very easily. I can't find any official word on whether this is machine washable, but a damp cloth works wonders and we have yet needed to put it totally in the wash. I assume it will be fine, but will update if and when that time comes! All of the buckles and the velcro and equally as pleasing in their quality, and I have no complaints here! Despite only having single stitching, all of the stitches are well done, which is usually a sign of good quality overall.DESIGNWell, there are several important points to mention here. The first is that the frame itself is nicely adjustable via the straps included. While this won't fit perfectly every time for every dog, I have found that cutting the straps once they have been fitted and burning the edges will allow for you to dispose of any extra length that may be present depending on your dogs size, without any fraying. The overall design of the frame is excellent, and does a good job of distributing any weight by using a wide surface area, and a harness-type set up at the front with two additional straps around the chest. The inner frame also has a handle, which is excellent for keeping your dog nearby when distractions are present.Moving on to the backpack itself, there are two large saddle bags that hang down on the sides, each with an interior mesh pocket along the inside. If I had one complaint about these saddle bags, it would be that there aren't smaller interior pockets for better organization, but more on that in my product suggestions. The backpack and frame have a total of four areas that have reflective material on them. This is great for night-time walks, allowing motorists to see that you're not the only one walking!FITOur dog is a 25lb whippet-shepherd mix (full grown) and has a pretty awkward body. We have the medium backpack, and while the frame fits very well, the saddle bags are a hair on the large size for her. She's pretty long (therefore tall when on her hinds legs) but pretty low to the ground. Still, I was pleased that this thing fit at all - I can't begin to list the many MANY accessories that simply don't fit our pup because of her awkward shape!PRODUCT SUGGESTIONSI have already spoken with the distributor about the following suggestions, and I am pleased to say that it seems as though the product designers are thinking along the same lines for one of two of them!- I think a good idea would be for outward hound to offer some sort of choice in terms of mixing and matching frames and backpacks. The medium frame is perfect for our pup, but as I mentioned the saddle bags are too big and I think the backpack section from the smaller model would be a better fit overall.- I would love to see some modularity be integrated with this backpack! By this I mean having some extra attachments that can be used besides the large backpack section that comes with the frames. Ideas include some smaller pouches that can be attached for those shorter trips - small compartments for treats and waste bags etc. That way you could attach smaller compartments for walks or trips to the dog park, and the bigger bags for longer excursions/camping etc. Something that I would LOVE to see would be a pouch that could fit a Camelbak-type water bladder that would distribute the weight of water evenly, rather than having a water bottle that pulls to one side.- I would also be very pleased if there was a way to attach a felt/flannel lining to the inner frame. That way the frame could be used by itself to keep a pup warm. Our dog is part whippet, and we often have a jacket on her in winter to keep her nice and cozy, but of course that adds extra bulk that makes the backpack a little uncomfortable. If they added the softer side of velcro to the frame, it could be worn by itself without discomfort, but also have the ability to add the warmer lining during the winter months! This is something that I will do to the internal frame anyway, hopefully I'll have pictures that I can put up soon for inspiration!OVERALLSimply because there is room for improvement, I would rate this product at four and a half stars if Amazon allowed it. The design and quality is simply fabulous, with a few areas of improvement (in my eyes) that can be made on the organizational aspect. Overall, however, I do love this product and therefore have awarded it five stars with a strong recommendation as a great product overall. If you are active with your dog, enjoy long hikes or camping, this is an almost-perfect accessory that is made to last!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 19, 2013", "summary": "A detailed review of an excellent backpack!"}

He was restless so the trainer gave him a kong to play with, and it was love and intrigue at first sight.  After the class, I bought him a small one - the same size the trainer had.  It became his pacifier and security blanket.  It was just small enough for him to hold it in his mouth by the top and he carried it everywhere and chewed on it even when it wasn't filled with treats.  He took it to bed with him at night and sometimes fell asleep with it in his mouth. I then read where the proper size kong for his size and weight was the larger one, and I got him that one.  He played with it while it was full of treats but then wouldn't touch it after that, preferring the small kong. Eventually the bottom part that holds the sand in the small kong became dislodged and the sand came out, which was actually a good thing since he was fond of dropping it full force on our tile floor, or dropping it down the stairs and watching it roll down until it crashed into the wall and on the tile.  We were afraid it would crack one of the tiles, but he loved it so much we couldn't take it away from him.  However, once we were able to get the sand container to adhere to the bottom again without the sand, it was much lighter and he still had his companion.  It didn't wobble as much, but it still wobbled enough to entertain him.  Not long after that, he figured out how to unscrew the top from the bottom (I KNEW we should have those dew claws removed...lol) and I found the two pieces chewed up to the point where they could not be screwed in together again.  He still brings me the top to fill, and I have to explain to him how it doesn't work anymore because he broke it.  He drops it and looks a little sad, so I'm going out today and buying a new one for him.  I think I will drill a hole in the bottom and drain the sand first to avoid the tile breaking issue.Bottom line......great toy for labs!UPDATE: In total, my lab has now completely disassembled and destroyed 3 of these Kongs - one being the largest they make and two being a size smaller.  I decided to go with the black Extreme Kong several months ago, and so far so good.  He likes it and plays with it, and has not (yet) found a method by which to destroy it.  :fingers crossed:  :)", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2013", "summary": "Great toy for curious dogs!"}

Excessive grains can cause long term issues in cats, particularly IBD.  Their system can't handle a lot of grains, so it wrecks havoc on their lower digestive system.  I know because my old cat got IBD and I fed her Purina cat food all of her life.  Towards the end of her life, (she is deceased now), she had uncontrollable issues that involved many accidents in the house.  I had to put her on medication in order to stabilize her system, and even then she still had terrible issues.I recently adopted a new kitten, and I am striving to find grain free food now.  Only time will tell, if doing that eliminates the painful digestive issues that my prior cat had.  Cats need protein, that is what they eat in the wild.  Feeding them excessive grains is like giving them junk food everyday.My cat dug right into this food.  The little pieces are flat, like a small disc.  Any size cat should be able to eat them.  At the time of this review, my cat is 5 months old, and devours this cat food.  I am still feeding herHill's Science Diet Kitten Healthy Development Original Dry Cat Food, 7-Pound Bag, because she is a kitten and want her to get all the vitamins she needs, but when she gets older I am going to switch solely to this grain free food.  If Science Diet had a grain free kitten food, I would purchase that instead.  I also feed her a grain free, wet cat foodSoulistic Pure Bliss Tuna Whole Meat Dinner Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy.  If you haven't tried the Soulistic, I seriously recommend you do.  It is the only cat food my cat will eat, consistently, even out of the refrigerator.There is a lot of food in this 11 pound bag!  It should last a long time.  It closes with a Velcro flap, which is so much more convenient then the Ziploc.  I had a hard time getting those cheap Ziploc's, that they put on cat food bags, to close.  So, if you are looking for a grain free cat food, from a company that has a good reputation, and is recommended by vets, give this a try.  If you buy it from your local veterinarian, ask them if they have a return policy.  Science Diet backs their food, and will take it back if it doesn't work for you.  My local vet will take back food that isn't used up, or doesn't work for my cat.

She seemed to stop and now the anxious male started spraying...great!AFTER VERIFYING THAT HE HAD NO MEDICAL ISSUES SUCH AS A BLADDER INFECTION via a full blood chem panel and urinalysis at the vet's office. I tried the calming collar. He and my mom's cat now wear it. They have both mellowed out: the girl is sweet and loving, she doesn't over lick causing skin issues, the boy doesn't run every time there's a loud noise, he's stopped spraying, and they both seem like they might even play together one day. They've been living together for about 6 months now.My local vet is the second vet I've had to recommend calming collars and/or Feliway. I swear it works.

The idea of the product is that your dog will wear this collar and you will always have a leash built in, just in case you go off-lead and Fido decides to bolt.  You are supposed to reach down and grab the collar, at which time, a thin, strong leash will unreel from the holder.  It has about a two-finger wide handle attached to a thin lead.Here is the major problem with this product (and I tried it on both my dog and gave it to my sister-in-law to try on her dog--really wanted to like this product!): When your small dog has this collar on, the leash part is heavy and bulky.  Because it is the heaviest part of the collar, it naturally ends up under the dog's neck. Both dogs were very irritated by the leash holder, as it bonked against their chest as they tried to walk (my sister-in-law's dog tried to chew it off).  When trying to quickly grab the leash, it was almost impossible to grab because the leash was underneath the dog.  I ended up grabbing the collar, flipping it around and then accessing the leash.  In the case of a quick grab, this product did not help at all.  Also, the leash is not that long.  Imagine a small dog, only about 6-8\" max. above ground.  Once I had a hold of the leash, the total length was barely enough so that the dog could walk (and I am a short person).In summary, I would not recommend this product for a small dog.  Perhaps the larger models work better, both due to the size of the animal/leash holder ratio and the height from the neck to the hand of the owner for leash length.

Previous to this one, my two adult cats enjoyed the one at half the price (Go Pet Club Cat Tree Beige Color).  It's a great introductory tree--if you can anchor it to the floor.  Soon my cats were toppling the entire structure on a regular basis.  The pictured one, however, has a much wider base and is, overall, better balanced and more stable.As others have mentioned, it's essential to tighten all parts to the max.  I regret not applying some extra muscle to the parts assembled by my wife, because the highest platform broke loose on the second day when my heavy black cat jumped up to its surface. I have yet to test the company's responsiveness to a request for another platform.  In the meantime, my cats are quite content with two platforms instead of three.Compared to the less expensive tree, this one has wider platforms with ledges, and my cats obviously take to them more than the smaller, plainer platforms, remaining content to sleep on them or to simply survey the curious humans below for hours at a time.  Moreover, I'm finding that the previous, smaller and lower tree still can be used productively, since cats are more than bird-catchers: they enjoy \"flying\"--from one vertiginous precipice to the next.  But expect to hear the sound of periodic thunderous crashes--unless you're able to anchor the bases securely.Of course, there are parts that go unused, making me wonder if the manufacturer actually tested these cat attractions with real cats.  Neither of my cats (one a runt) ever used the lower enclosed part on the earlier model.  On the this model, they've ignored both ladders altogether (may as well toss the lower one), and only the higher, smaller enclosure has occasionally seen some occupancy.I've owned 10 cats (or vice versa), but most were obtained as kittens, which I was able to convince were dogs.  In each case, the relationship took priority over cats' more \"picturesque posturings.\"  But since I began adopting adult cats from the shelter--animals with ingrained habits and inherited traits--the tree towers have given both the cats and their guardians the greatest gratification.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2014", "summary": "Easily worth twice the price (buy direct from Amazon, tighten all parts thoroughly)"}

Have to throw it away and go  back to the store for the original antlers we get that are heavier and solid.  I guess these are cured in a different way and that may cause them to crumble.1 week later ...update ~ I went to pet store and picked up a new elk antler which was heavier and more solid then this one.  It's lasting a long time and no shards.  I won't buy on line again since in my opinion these are definitely one of those things you need to feel and see prior to purchasing.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2013", "summary": "shards"}

Kibbles were EVERYWHERE.When you first get it, only put maybe 5-10 kibbles or treats into it, so you can gauge whether the dog is more interested in the treats that come out, or the sounds it makes.Since then, I adjusted the center part to have a very small hole, so it's really hard for kibbles to come out of it. That seems to work very nicely.The ball would probably be too big for very small breeds of dog to play with, and doesn't seem like it would withstand the rigors that a really big (100+lbs) dog would put it through.

Treats, and lots of petting, were used to let my dog know that everything was OK, and he obeyed my order.  \"Good boy!  Here's a treat.\"  I believe it really made all the difference in how my dog interpreted those initial shocks. Additionally, if you take your dog out for off-leash fun at night, purchase the optional (red, white, or blue) light that can be added on to the collar for $44 or so.

This is not a no-pull harness nor does it claim to be. He can pull more on it but I only use it for his 'fun walks' not going to the vet or some other public place where I need control. The other thing I like is that it is not a step in harness. He does not have to lift a paw to get it on which is easier for me. He is older and has knee trouble and is sometimes unsteady if you pick up a front paw. The only thing I an not crazy about is that if he is behind me and I tug to get him moving it will shift around. Not sure if I need it tighter or if that is just going to happen. The result of this is that it seems like his coat is a bit roughed up where the harness sits. Not a bid deal I guess. All in all I am happy with it.Also I have the chest plate harness made by EzyDog that I use in the car to clip to the seatbelt leash I use. That one is a bit of a pain to put on partly because he has to step in but partly the way it is designed. I was hoping to use this one instead in the car but because it still puts some pressure on the neck I am not sure it is safe for that purpose. It is not marketed for that and I am not faulting the product for that, just thought I would mention that for others wanting to use as a seatbelt...UPDATE 1/2013: I got a second dog who is smaller but right on the line in the manufacturers size chart between large and extra large so I ordered the large and it is much too small. The chest strap on its largest adjustment doesn't allow the harness to go far enough back. After reading other reviews talking about rubbing under the arms I am pretty sure many reviewers have it adjusted too small as it is supposed to a few fingers be behind the armpit. On my other dog when it's adjusted right it sits where it should but does ride forward where it could chafe though it doesn't seem to sit there enough. All in all this is my favorite harness and every one comments on it. If your dog is on the line as far as size particularly if they are wide in the chest I would go with the larger size.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 23, 2012", "summary": "Shifts around but not bad"}

She has a sore on her face that she has scratched and our puppy has licked into a mess. Her neck is 11&#34; around and her head size is standard for her mix.  I could have gone with a medium but I feel it would have been too large and way to heavy for her to carry around. The small is ok at the neck, it allows me to leave the neck a little loose (minimal overlap right at the neck) and still have overlap out at the end. The collar is close to being too small right at the neck, but the instructions say allow 2 fingers space in the neck which I have, but it feels like the weight of it will press down on her throat so I'm keeping a close eye on her. I also bought this today in an emergency situation for 39.00 at a local large pet store.Basically, the small fits her, she has a shorter snout so can eat without having to fold it down, and it's keeping her from scratching her face. She has long legs but can not reach her feet or stomach so this would work for a spay. She's very comfortable laying down and because there's a lot of overlap at the outside edge, the smaller neck opening is working for her. The weight is tolerable, but to have overlap the entire length of the cone like the picture shows, I would have to go to the medium which was very heavy and would not have worked for her.  When I first put it on she tried to take it off but within seconds was fine with it.  I think the size of the dog is what will make or break this collar. If she had less body it would be too heavy, if her snout was longer she could get to her front feet, if her neck was shorter the weight would likely hurt her throat.  My suggestion would be to take your dog to the local Petco, try one on, then order the size from Amazon to save yourself $20.00+. You can get it delivered before a spay and have it for those emergencies that sometimes come up.  While she slightly unhappy at having to wear this thing, she is comfortable and her wound is healing. I am extremely happy with this purchase, just wish I had bought it from Amazon and had it waiting for a situation like this.When she was spayed I tried the plastic e collar, it was terrible. I felt like I needed to hold her and try to make her head comfortable, I finally threw it out and just keep a tea towel taped around her and kept a close eye on her. It was a long week.

When we first got Conner the Conure (a green cheek conure with the pineapple mutation), he was a sweet bird, but he was a little nippy and very independent. He liked tickles on his head and neck, but when he was done and had enough, he'd bite with no warning. He wasn't a cuddler or anything like that either. This was hard for me, since all the birds I've had when growing up were all very cuddly and sweet. In fact, all birds I've known are cuddly sweet like that, at least some of the time.I loved Conner (my conure), and he was fun and full of personality, but he just wasn't very 'friendly' over all. He wouldn't stay sitting on my shoulder (or anyone's) for very long, wouldn't let us tickle his neck for long, nothing. Affection was available, but only in short bouts before he'd bite and then fly back to his cage.Then I bought this perch for him. and I put it on the outside of his cage, so that he hung over my shoulder while I sat in the recliner and did my routine. I work from home, and usually sit in my recliner when I'm working, and now, his cage beside me, I'd let him out and work. This rope perch was right over my shoulder the whole time I was working. I'd basically ignore him, and he'd eventually come down and walk out on the perch and sit over my shoulder. He say, &#34;Watcha doing?&#34; and I'd talk to him. He liked to watch my computer screen (especially when I played Candy Crush, with all the bright colors--but you know, I was, ahem, usually working!)And in just a couple of weeks, he went from a standoffish independent birdie who didn't interact much with us, to a bird who came straight to his rope perch the minute I let him out. So I started rubbing his neck and scratching his pinfeathers when he was on the perch and he would come and sit as close to me as he could while on the perch. In just a couple of more weeks, he was leaning against my head when he would get tired and was sleeping on me like that.Today, he sleeps in my hand, cuddles with me all the time, comes and lays in my hand if I put it up on the perch next to him. He gives kisses and asks for tickle-tickles on his neck. He hasn't bitten anyone in months and months now.Using this perch to let him be close to me, but not actually feel trapped by me, let him get used to being around me, and slowly, we learned how to interact with each other. I can now literally turn him upside down in my hand, cuddle with him on my chest or under my hair, you name it. He's the sweetest, funniest bird.And his rope perch is still right there on his cage and he sits on it right by me all day long while I'm working. I plan to get a couple more of these so I can put some perches up in the bathroom. I want to see if he can get used to taking a shower with me now. I've heard birds like that, sometimes, because it's like bathing in the rain for them. We'll see if it works. Also, I thin his little feet like the softer surface of the rope perch as  a change for the little talons sometimes.The rope is stiff but wiggly enough to position however you want. it's held up well. I do have to turn it over every now and then, 'cause it will start to droop downward at the part near the connectors, but flipping it over will fix that right up, until it starts to droop again, then just flip it again.A good, quality product and very safe for birdies and works great with the cage. Note: This doesn't have the suction cups for using on walls or glass/windows/mirrors.

We get the small - the others are simply too long and big for me to throw and he seems to like the small ones the best.He used to run with (real) sticks in his mouth and once stabbed himself with one of them when it caught in the ground while he was moving.  That was the moment when I decided that we would have no more wooden stick play...enter, Kong Safestix!These are perfect for us.  No risk of tooth or mouth injury, we can play tug with them all day long (seriously, HE can go all day long, my arms can only take so much) and they're pretty easy to find in the long grass.  The suckers even float which has come in handy when he goes to get a drink from the stream and drops his Safestix in the water, making me have to run downstream to try to get it out...sigh, he's not a retriever, he's a shepherd.  I'm the retriever.My guy likes me to throw it high and spinning so he can get a bead on where it's going and try to get there just as the Safestix is coming down.  I hurl it by one of the rounded ends to give it a nice spin, which helps him spot it against the sky.And I'll tell you, he bites down on these things HARD, but hasn't damaged one yet.  We play tug every day with me dragging 80+lbs of dog around with them and they hold up great.He doesn't chew on them, though, and I know some folks have had issues with that.  My guy just wants to fetch and tug, so for that they're awesome.I do wish that they were a bit brighter/more solid color just for visibility (especially in water), but that's the only improvement I would need.If your dog is a fetching machine like mine, I really recommend these.UPDATE - 7-9-14 - Well, we finally broke one today!  As the stix get bitten/tugged over time, they get cuts in them from sharp doggie teeth and they seem to stretch a bit.

We have a rescue dog who is adapting to a house with 2 cats who have had full-claim of their home for several years.  Both sides are stressed at the changes and have been showing it in various ways.Our puppy is crated to sleep, and usually likes her little den and bed.  During the night, though, she will bark, yip, and whine for anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, 3 or 4 times per night.  We've gone up to 4 hours straight of barking right in the middle of the night.  Any time there's so much as a strong breeze which shifts the house she'll start up.  We're afraid to get up for water or anything like that because any noise (or sometimes even no noise) will set her off.I can't overstate how skeptical I was about this product, but this was a last-ditch effort to save my sanity so I figured it couldn't possibly hurt.  I plugged this thing in right above her crate.  For the last couple weeks it has been running non-stop and there hasn't been a single incident of mid-night barking.  Not a single one.  No whining, no yips, no howls, it's like we have a new dog.To take this a step further, normally if someone walks near her crate after she's been sleeping for a bit she'll jump up and start hopping around in there.  She'll bark if you don't come let her out.  She actually destroyed one crate this way, and has broken several of the metal bars on her newest crate.  This morning I walked right past her den and she stood up, yawned, realized I wasn't coming over to her, and lay right back down calmly.  She waited that extra minute until I came over to let her out, then stepped out slowly, no mad bull-rush out the door.I'm still skeptical, part of me can't help but feel that this must be coincidence, but I'm willing to pay for a monthly refill if only for my peace of mind.  I highly recommend trying this product out if you have a hyper or stressed out dog, it's saved my sanity.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 1, 2011", "summary": "Very skeptical, but it works for our dog"}

Or the other way around maybe. The last of my rotties passed last summer, and I fed them Canidae their entire lives. All three of them enjoyed a sick-visit free lives. Why is this pertinent to Iams? For one, it is proof that the price for this product pays itself off. Your dog is what he eats. My rotties all lived over 10 years with no joint or bone problems. None of the dreaded osteoscarcoma. And I attribute it to the food they ate 1000%.So fast forward a few months and Vine offers me this Iams Sensitive Naturals. I no longer have a dog, but I know a few underprivalaged pooches. ;) The taste test was a hit, the ingredients are right. Fish is the first ingredient, rice is the second. Look at the food you feed your dog. Is corn the first ingredient? Are the meats real meat or by-products? Are there beets in the product to aid your dog's digestion? What about nasty dyes?The ingredients, per the item description:Ocean Fish, Brewers Rice, Ground Whole Grain Sorghum, Fish Meal (source of fish oil), Ground Whole Grain Barley, Animal Fat (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Dried Egg Product, Dried Beet Pulp, Fish Digest, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dicalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride,Salt, Dried Apple Pomace, Dried Carrots, Dried Peas, Fructooligosaccharides, Minerals (Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Manganous Oxide, Potassium Iodide, Cobalt Carbonate), Dried Spinach, Dried Tomatoes, Choline Chloride, DL-Methionine, Vitamins (Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin A Acetate, Calcium Pantothenate, Biotin, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of vitamin B1), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Niacin, Riboflavin Supplement (source of vitamin B2), Inositol, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (source of vitamin B6), Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid), Calcium Carbonate, Vitamin E Supplement, Beta-Carotene, Rosemary Extract.A few things of note -Tocopherols vs. BHA are used as preservativesApple Pomace - just a fancy term for skins, pulp, seeds, and stems of applesBrewer's Dried Yeast - good for skin and coat, may increase bloating and gas.Most of these ingredients are vitamins and minerals. There are 6 fruits and veggies in the kibble, which of course is a step above your average kibble. The value of the kibble is in what is absent - corn.I would suggest comparing labels with your current brand. If you are feeding cheap, you might be saving money in the short term only to spend a lot more on a sick dog later on. Good dog food is not going to be cheap, because the ingredients aren't cheap. Personally, I am very fond of Canidae because it gave our dogs such wonderful health (and as I am sure you know, rottweilers are so prone to health issues) and it is also an economical choice in food. However, this offering from Iams is a very solid dog food with a similiar nutritional profile. It is quite a bit more per pound than my preferred food, so I took off one star as I feel it would be a better value at a lower price point..", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2011", "summary": "Iams steps it up"}

Keep a large supply on hand.  You will be replacing this media at least once per month, depending on your situation.The Fluval U2 underwater/internal filter uses a total of five filter medias: 2 coarse foam, 2 poly/carbon pads, and 40 grams of ceramic bio-media.  This is the one that you would need to replace frequently.  The coarse foam can be rinsed out and re-used, being made of inert material.  The ceramic bio-media can also be rinsed out, but should only be replaced if they are extremely dirty.I do not know how ceramic bio-media can get dirty enough to the point that they will need to be thrown away, but I suppose it can happen.  Here's a potential scenario, if you used copper to medicate the tank at some point in the past, and now you want to keep invertebrates, then yes, you will need to replace all of the media in your filter.  Even the ones that are considered inert, since even a small trace of copper can harm your shrimp.The Fluval U2 will run just fine without a poly/carbon pad installed.  Set up as such, it will still function as a coarse mechanical filter and as a submerged biological filter.  You just lose chemical filtration.  This is an advantage to you during those times when you have to add medication to your tank.How well does this filter pad do its job?  It does a fine job of filtering out smaller particles.  These are particles that are too small be captured by the coarse mechanical filter.  However, it does a poor job of chemical filtration.  This is not surprising, when you consider that this pad does not hold granular activated carbon.  Instead, one side of the pad contains bonded carbon.  There is very little actual carbon in the product.  What you have is carbon bonded to the filter material.  Do not expect this filter pad to remove tannins from the water.  It may remove a little bit, for a short period of time, but do not expect it to keep the water from turning yellow if you have driftwood in the tank.  There may be enough carbon there to remove medication from the water.It is hard to review a filter media without taking into the consideration the whole system.  The Fluval U-series of internal filters are excellent products.  The smallest model, the U1, provides simple mechanical filtration.  The rest of the series, provides complete filtration.  So these systems can be a replacement for a hang-on-the-back power filter.  The Fluval U2 will do a fine job of mechanical filtration, primarily because of this filter pad.  But you do have to replace the pad often.  If you are not too concerned about chemical filtration, you can replace the poly/carbon pads once per month.  You can even alternate, by replacing only one of the pads, instead of both.I do recommend replacing at least one of the pads, every month.  Mechanical filtration captures solid waste and puts them where they cannot be seen.  However, please keep in mind that they are still in the water.  The trapped solid waste in the filter pad is still decomposing within the tank, releasing nitrates into your water.  Even if they are no longer in the water column, they are still in the path of the water circulation.  The best strategy that I have found is to use a simple filter that is very easy to clean.  Clean often.  Remove as much solid waste from circulation as possible.  This will help keep nitrate levels down and may help keep algae under control.  This idea is also the reason why I have gradually replaced my canister filters with simple, HOB power filters.  Many years ago, I kept some wild-caught pike cichlids.  I was using a large Fluval 403 canister filter.  My routine back then was to put as much media within the bucket/canister as would fit.  And then only open the canister for maintenance every 3-4 months.  After all, the service interval for canister filters are long, right?  Sure, the canister will hold a lot of waste, but just because it's in the container does not mean that it is no longer polluting the tank.  You are better off spending your money on a modest filter and cleaning it out often, rather than spending a lot of money on a filter that you will not clean out often.  Am I saying that simple and cheap are better than a pricey canister filter?  No, not at all.  My point is, whichever filter type you choose, to clean it often.  If you want a canister, and you are willing to go through the hassle of cleaning it once a week, then you have the best of both worlds.  I suspect that most people would be more consistent in monthly filter maintenance if it were simple and easy.While an internal filter like the Fluval U is not as easy as your typical HOB power filter to clean, it is still easier than a canister.  And having pre-made filter media makes the job even easier.  Stock up on the replacement filter pads.  Replace them often.  That is an easy way to remove solid waste from your tank.  This is a much better maintenance practice than letting the waste accumulate.  You can make it even more convenient if you buy the pads in larger quantities.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2014", "summary": "Stock up!"}

I had read great things about this carrier and it seemed to be the best all-around choice.PROS:(1) Larger and taller than other carriers for the pup's comfort. Our dog can move around in the carrier relatively easily, but it is a bit tight. She has to bend down a tiny bit to get in or out, but she looks comfortable once she turns around inside and curls up.(2) Although it is larger, it does squish down and would fit in a tighter space if needed.(3) It really is sturdy and made with great materials. I was worried about the mesh in particular, but it is  a strong plastic type material. My dog can lean against it or paw at it a little bit, and I don't worry about her accidentally breaking through.(4) There are plenty of ventilation windows - two on the top, one on the front, and one on the back. They open as well, so I can pet my dog without her hopping out.CONS:(1) There is only one door! I agree with another reviewer, if you have a smallish-medium dog it is kind of awkward for them to get in and out (they have to turn around to face the door and unless you have a teeny, small framed dog, it is tight). A number of times, it was awkward for me too, because I unzipped the wrong side and had to turn the carrier around to get to the door. Perhaps I am still getting used to this carrier...Not a huge deal, but 2 doors would definitely make this a 5-star product!Otherwise, we like the carrier and our dog seems to be fine with it as well.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2012", "summary": "So far so good!"}

Fortunately she loves to play fetch so we can TRY to wear her out with this activity.  The problem was that within a few weeks of adopting her, my throwing arm ached like crazy.  I didn't know launchers even existed when I turned to the internet to solve my problem, but my husband is an engineer so I decided if I couldn't find something, I would ask him to design one.  Well, it didn't take long to find the Chuck-It and I ordered two of them - the long one and the mini.Side note: my 13YO son was unaccountably excited when he heard I'd ordered a ball launcher and surprisingly disappointed when it arrived.  It turns out, he had visions of rocket launchers and had envisioned a machine that would launch the ball out of sight and couldn't wait to see it in action.  His disappointment was in its simplicity and the fact it would require actual manual effort on our part to get it to work.  LOL.I, however, am NOT disappointed.  I use the mini most of the time and love how far I can throw the ball without my arm aching at all.  It was so easy to learn to use and with a little practice I am accurate enough to hit a tree (if I want to) with it so the ball goes exactly where I want it to, every time.  My dog LOVES the launcher.  She starts dancing in circles as soon as she sees me pick it up.One of the best features of the launcher is that I no longer have to handle a soggy ball.  When she drops the ball at my feet, all I do is scoop it back up in the launcher and throw it again.  At the end of the session, I scoop it up and it lives in the launcher until the next session.  This is such an incredible bonus they should charge extra for it.My husband is better with the long one.  I find it harder to get the ball to release in time so it doesn't go as far for me as with the mini.  I know its just a learning curve and I need to learn to flick my wrist back slightly to release it at the best time, but I'll confess I haven't taken the time to practice this.  Also, the large one, having so much longer a handle tends to flex when I try to pick up the ball so its actually harder to do this.  I would like to try the in-between size to see if I can throw the ball further than with the mini but still pick the ball up easily.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2011", "summary": "Saved my elbows"}

It is the only washable pad brand I've used.  PoochPads has their own web site, I notice. Since i purchased from a retail store, I cannot speak for the 1-star reviewer who had a problem with non-shipment and poor customer service.From googling just now, I see there are other brands of washable pads available so shopping around by price might be advised.  I certainly am not a shill for any one brand!  Just be sure to take shipping charges into consideration.  I notice that the PoochPads now all have a cutesy print on them.  Mine are plain beige and grey, which I much prefer.  I saw another brand that had both solid color and print so when I need to replace, I may be switching.  A sewer might also consider making their own if they can find the right materials.I do use my pads in a floor protector tray with lock down frame.  This might be an answer for those with puppies who scrape and/or chew.  I didn't have that problem.  My tray is so my blind old dog could have discernible boundaries.  Might also help also where the pad has to be on carpet.All in all, I highly recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2010", "summary": "Wonderful product"}

The toy is shaped like a child's spinning top, with two halves (top and bottom) that unscrew from each other. You unscrew the top half, and try to balance the bottom half with one hand while you pour doggy kibble and tiny, cut-up treats into the bottom half. Once the bottom half is full, you use your \"food pouring hand\" to screw the top half back on. It's a bit of a balancing act, and I prefer theOmega Paw Tricky Treat Ball, because the Omega ball is much easier to fill. Maybe two parent families will have an easier time with the Premier.As for doggie enjoyment, my puppy likes the Premier Twist and Treat well enough, mostly because he's discovered that one really hard bat of the paw will cause the toy to spin on its axis and pretty much expel all the food right away. (My puppy is currently 4 months old, and 12 pounds.) Once again, for a better time-to-treat ratio, I recommend the Omega ball.Still, the puppy likes both the Premier and Omega and I like giving him a variety of toys, so this gets 4 stars from me. I have not had any troubles with toy durability, but I'm also blessed with a puppy that doesn't chew very much (yet!). I *highly* recommend filling this toy primarily with the dog's usual kibble, with a few treats interspaced in the mix as \"surprises\". There's really no need to stuff it full of treats - the puppy enjoys the toy just as much, and it makes \"dinner time\" a more interactive and exercising experience! I chop my doggie treats up very finely for training purposes and my puppy is always eager for the taste of a treat without filling up or getting sluggish or fat.~ Ana Mardoll", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2008", "summary": "Prefer Omega, but..."}

Putting it together was very easy, it didn't take me very long to do. I put it in a corner of the living room imagining that she would enjoy watching what was going on here, but she seemed disinterested. So I decided to move it to the dining room, where she could watch the garden or me, depending on her mood.I have tendinitis in my left shoulder, so I was a bit sceptical to move it myself, but it is very light, so I managed to lift it up on the sofa and carry/drag it into the dining room. I wrote it off as yet another purchase the cat wouldn't use.Well, as time went by, she decided it was a nice place to rest. She didn't go to the top level for some reason, and she couldn't care less about the play ball. She doesn't go into the \"hideout\", but I never expected her to do that. She doesn't like to be covered, my little cat, too scared for that.Anyway, the last few days I've found her resting on the top level. Seems she's decided that even that is a good place to sleep. She gets her tree to herself, she can look at what she wants, and sleep in the darkness of a room that isn't in use. So in the end, it was worth it.Now, my cat aside, it is a good tree house. It has lots of areas to scratch on, it's very soft to rest on, lots of levels to jump on, high enough to look down on most people, and has hideouts and play things. It is easy to put together, feels sturdy and not easy to push over, yet light enough to lift and move by a single person. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a tree.ETA 2012-05-26: I have had this tree for about a year and a half now, and it's become a beloved furniture in the house. I moved earlier this year, and this tree was manhandled, not very gently. It was not taken apart, moved as is, and the only damage is that the ball had disappeared.

I thought this would be a good alternative. Upon receiving it I was happy with its construction.  An hour later we were at the park and then I realized how terrible this product actually is.  First, it doesn't fly like frisbee. It's basically a heavy hunk of rubber that barely produces any lift at all.  When you throw it, it goes maybe 30 feet before falling straight to the ground.  You might as well throw a rubber ball - at least they bounce around when they hit the ground.  So right off the bat I knew I was going to return it.  Then my dog headed for the lake.  All the other frisbee's I had purchased floated.  Even the ones that were cheap (like a buck at the local CVS) managed to stay on top of the water.  On my first toss into the lake this disc sank like a rock.  So now I'm out the money I spent on this after playing with it for about 10 minutes and no where on the packaging does it say not to use this product in water.  Other than this company's primary chew toy, I'll never purchase another thing from them again.  This was a total waste of money.

With the exception of stuffed Kong, all of the other toys he has require our involvement because we need to either play tug or throw them to him in a game of fetch.The only negative of this chew is that it leaves small plastic crumbs in places where our dog chewed the bone. Although it is harder to break off large pieces of plastic from it, occasionally our dog ends up swallowing what he manages to scrape off the bone.

This is a  nice looking tank compared to the other brands I tried for example the tetra 2gal and  a few others. However, I do have to agree with a few of the other reviews when they said that the pumps were a little too big for the tank. what I did was put a filter sponge on the end where the water gets filtered out to the tank and it did the job. I have a small beta fish so the current could not be too strong. be sure you inspect the tank be for you take the tank home from the store I found one that had a broken part on the pump. good luck friends.Update 1: Dec.1,2012well I love the tank but found out that the sponge trick isn't working so im going to have to find another alt.

This is definitely large enough for him to move around in, turn around, get comfortable, and rest. Has a removable bottom tray I guess in case you need to clean it out. I use a dog bed in it as well. Was a simple design and setup was easy; everything just folds out and clips together.The only real problem I had with this is one day the dog managed to get the side door open. The latches are really loose sliding latches. So enough jostling of the cage over enough time (the side door was never actually used, so I never bothered to inspect the latches), and they worked themselves free. I had seen him do it with the front door latches one at a time before (over a single night), so I should've expected this to happen to both latches. I now use carabiners on one latch per side. Makes it easy to take off and secures it from being accidently worked opened.I had a similar sized full plastic carrier cage years ago that I liked a lot less. While that one was more \"mobile\" (although hardly anything that sized and with a dog that size is carry/mobilized), the hard plastic started to become brittle with age, and broke apart at latch points and handle points. I think this metal one will last a lot longer, and I like that it's more open for the dog. It does come with small carrying handles but I don't know if I'd try to move it with a dog in it.

When we get home or to the dog park, I just unclick the neck clip and my dog steps out of the leg areas. It takes an extra 20-30 seconds to get him strapped into it, but it is SO worth it. Try it for your dog. If it doesn't work, pass it on to another dog owner.

Basically a 5 minute brushing about every 3rd day cuts the fur found all over the house down to maybe 10% of what we were getting before.  This brush is an outstanding product, but it does pull a bit more than my older type brushes and combs, so you do need to start out gently to get the dog used to it, and then over time you can be a bit more firm as you brush to get more fur out.

I'd start off maybe with a smaller bag though to make sure they'll eat them- One my cats refuses to because they are so big and you can't really break them in half, as the outside is more of a hard 'skin' vs. a crust and they will basically fall apart once attempt to do that.I highly recommend this product!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2012", "summary": "Great For Feline Dental Health!"}

She will poop in her litter boxes but she does number one on carpet or other soft absorbent surface.  We (my cat and I) are now living in the non-carpeted part of the house.  I have been using Iris brand training pads and was anxious to compare their performance with these pads.  For my cat I place a small folded blanket on the vinyl floor and cover it with a training pad.  I use the blanket because my cat seeks out cushy (which equates to absorbent in her tiny mind) places to pee on.  The system has been working well for us.  Because my cat has CRF she drinks a lot of water.  She holds it until she is about to burst and so she puts out a lot of urine all at once.  The training pads have to work hard to keep up and both brands do an acceptable job most times depending of course on how close to the edge of the pad she squats.  I am home a lot  and when I go out, three times a week, I am only away for two hours.  So the pads are used only once and in our situation I can't imagine them being able to hold more.  I used to immediately go to deal with the pad as soon as it was used but I've learned to wait at least a few minutes because the pad needs time to fully absorb making for a tidier pick-up and dispose process.  These pads are a few inches larger than the medium sized Iris pads and they have a smoother slicker waterproof backing.  Also these pads are fluffier and the absorbent side feels more cloth-like than the Iris.  Bought in 100 count packs from Amazono the Iris pad are around 22 cents each and these pads in the 50 count pack are about 25 cents.  If these pads out-performed the Iris or if the larger size mattered to me then I would switch brands.  But the two brands are equally effective and the Iris are large enough for my purposes so I will stick with them.  I thought the softer cloth-like feel of the Pruven pads would cause my cat to prefer them but she usually picks the Iris one to go on.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 3, 2012", "summary": "Using these for my cat"}

For some reason, this one still has her stumped. Overall this toy is great for my dog, me and my wallet.

The Sky Kennel seemed to be the generally accepted standard for airline approved crates, so that's what we went with.The crate is well-built, and I particularly liked the vault style door in the front.  The locking mechanism for most kennels has two pins that lock into the top and bottom of the crate.  While generally it's pretty secure, it is possible to not get both of the pins seated sometimes which can lead to the dog getting out.  The vault style has four pins, and they insert into all four sides of the crate.  While my dog isn't an escape artist, this four-pin lock can only be closed if all four pins are inserted properly, so you don't have to worry about partially securing the door.  It's either locked or not, and it's pretty obvious when you do it.There is also a safety latch on the lock which prevents it from moving accidentally.

Even finicky eaters will eagerly accept bloodworms.  The most appealing form of bloodworms is naturally, live bloodworms.  Unfortunately, most hobbyists do not have the time to manage and farm bloodworms.  So, your choices are generally frozen or freeze dried.  The fish prefer frozen, but they will eagerly accept freeze-dried almost as enthusiastically.  And of the freeze-dried commercial foods in the market, Hikari seems to have the best reputation from hobbyists, as determined from internet forums.These are actually not worms, but rather insect larva.  They are not your typical strongyloid, internal parasite that you may find in livestock.  These &#34;bloodworms&#34; are similar to mosquito larva.  They sell them in different sizes.  Some are small, like mosquito larvae.  The ones that you can buy frozen from San Francisco Bay Brands are typically much larger, more than a half-inch long.  If you have smaller fish, say neon tetras, get the smaller variety.  You can even get frozen &#34;glass worms&#34;, which are mosquito larva.  The Hikari freeze-dried product is the same size as mosquito larva.  Maybe they started out larger and the drying process cause them to shrink.  This freeze dried bloodworm food is small enough to feed to neon tetras.Should you feed frozen or freeze-dried?  That really depends on how picky your fish are.  Some wild-caught specimens may not accept freeze-dried at first.  You may have to start them off on frozen, as that will be the closest thing to live food.  But, if your fish will accept freeze-dried, that is what I would recommend.  The freeze-drying process most likely eliminated the chances of the food bringing unwanted parasites into your fish tank.  It's safer than feeding live or frozen foods.  What you are hoping for is that eventually, you can transition your fish into flakes and pellets.Highly recommended.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2014", "summary": "A treat for your fish!"}

I first trained my Havanese to use them as a puppy when I lived in a New York City apartment. I've continued using them for convenience while I am working and because he prefers them to going outside in poor weather. I now have a second puppy who is also training on them.My absolute favorite brand of wee pads is called Paw Trax. They have an incredibly fast absorbing gel inside that nothing I've found matches. I've only found them online on two dog specialty websites, but they are pretty pricey at about $.50 each! Not wanting to break the bank, I went in search of other brands. At first I discounted Wee Wee Pads because my local pet superstore sold them at such an outrageous price that the Paw Trax were a better deal. Then, I found them on Amazon at a much better price, especially for the 100 pack.These pads, while not the best in my opinion, absorb fairly quickly and are more absorbent than some of the other bargain brands. The only problem I've experienced with them is that sometimes the pee seems to expand fairly wide when it is absorbing, which means it's only good for one use. Having two dogs, sometimes that means my second dog will not use the pad if I'm not around to change it.  Other than that issue, I've never encountered anything else negative such as seeping through the plastic liner, etc.I'm also fond of the Nature's Miracle Advanced pads which are larger and better suited for multiple uses. While these don't seem to absorb as quickly, they don't expand out as much. That combined with their larger size makes them ideal for my multi-dog home.

We also live in a VERY hard water area. There is nothing about the fountain or the filters that will \"soften\" the water, that is not what they're for.  The idea is to get cats--descended from North African Desert animals---to drink more water.  Its better for their kidneys; they'll likely live longer. ( A high percentage of older cats die from kidney failure, it is very common. Many veterenarians now are encouraging the  use of some canned or \"wet\" cat food in a cat's diet to provide more moisture, since most cats aren't big on drinking....thats in part what all this is about.)As other posters have commented, my former cats always wanted the tap water on a \"thin\" drip or flow of water. It had to be \"just so\"...not too much, not too little...but they preferred drinking that water over their water in bowls, no matter how often the bowls were changed/cleaned. (Yes, I tried glass, ceramic, stainless steel, every recommendation about what type of bowls cats are said to prefer...)When the cat water fountains first came out I was skeptical at first...but it made sense, obviously this re-created what the cats preferred.  The running water, the sound....so I got one.The critical element after buying the fountain is maintaining it.  READ the directions!  Change the filters \"every 2-4 weeks depending on the size and number of pets using the fountain\".  Thats from the back of the Drinkwell filter package.  And please use Drinkwell filters if you have a Drinkwell fountain!  They are made to work together.CLEAN the fountain...including the little parts around the motor.  We take it apart about every other week and put the entire fountain, minus motor, in the upper section of the dishwasher, and run it, with the usual dishwashing detergent,  which works great.  The motor area can be cleaned with q-tips or the special brushes sold by Drinkwell.  If the fountain is not kept clean  and the fiilters are not replaced, the whole thing will stop working, though long before that your cats will be drinking recycled dirty water.This isn't hard, just a bit of reminding yourself.  Just like with your car, there is basic cleaning and maintenance required.Also, reading some other posters: please don't use BLEACH to clean the fountain...plastic of all kind (think Tupperware) absorbs odors, I can't imagine a cat with his/her sensitive nose drinking water after the unit the cleaned w/ bleach, no matter how dilute.  Also the vinegar and water thing....thats better than bleach but are you really cleaning the unit?

Also used a sticky paper Victor Ultimate Flea Trap (Amazon), but we use the flea trap more as a measure of how bad the infestation is; it will not solve the problem. Count the fleas trapped in 24 hours, when it gets down to 1 or 2 you just about have things under control. Zero and you can break out the champagne.The Siphotrol products seem to be largely effective immediately.  The label says it kills adult fleas on contact and I won't argue with that but the critters seem to hide or hatch continuously.  It certainly knocks down the population but it takes another week or so to eliminate the problem.  It did not require a second application.  Also, if you've chased fleas you know they're fast and elusive, but after the Siphotrol, if they're still living they're pretty lethargic.We used the Siphotrol product on the carpet and furniture, and Barklogic's Lemongrass Tick and Flea Pet Wash (Amazon) on the dogs, one application each and the problem was maybe 90+% resolved the first day, stragglers gone within a week.  The Siphotrol has almost no smell, nothing residual. Though the dogs love to swim, they have always loathed a bath.  FWIW there's something about this Lemongrass product that they both liked, very mild, pleasant aroma and you could see the fleas going down the drain.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2012", "summary": "Effective, Mostly Immediately, 100% Takes Longer, Good Stuff"}

Slip the neck portion over the head, and a quick snap of the belly strap, and it's on almost before they figure out what you're doing.

I'm not afraid she'll get hurt if she suddenly bolts and is snagged by the harness at the end of the leash. The pressure is distributed across the chest and shoulders and is soft, rather than cutting in at a single point like a collar.As fussy as cats are about wearing any such thing, every one I've tried this on has been okay with it, accepting it much more quickly and easily than a standard strap-type collar/harness.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2012", "summary": "Medium size for 11 lb.

We have worked very hard to teach our dogs to walk with a loose leash using all kinds of positive reinforcement and even a gentle leader. We resisted going to a training collar for months. The dogs will do all kinds of obedience behaviors easily now, but when they are out with each other or other dogs, they pull like sled dogs to the point that they are gasping for breath straining against their flat collars. They are immune to leash pops and the tastiest treats. The entire experience feels abusive to the dogs and to us. The trainer who leads the Big Dawgs MeetUp training sessions here in San Antonio recommended one of these plastic training collars as a possible solution to our problem. The dogs' attitudes changed immediately and they were far more willing to walk politely with the leash loose. Now when they see us reach for these collars they get excited because they know they are going out on some kind of adventure. We can take them for walks in crowded areas, to lunch at dog-friendly restaurants, and many other places that would be an ordeal with a flat collar. Ideally we will be able to habituate them to a loose leash with a flat collar or even heeling off-leash (where that is safe and permitted). This is our ultimate goal which is why \"training collar\" is an appropriate name for these wonderful devices. We use the small one on the puppy and the large one with our adult dog. Both are adjustable by adding and removing links. By the way, just to be on the safe side we also use a leash with two attachments so the dog is secured with the flat collar just in case there is a malfunction with the training collar. It's a nice insurance policy that we probably will never need. It's Leerburg's Leather Prong Collar Leash, available at the Leerburg site or on Amazon.

I'm an over-planner, it's true. ;) It also lets folks with dogs who may fair better walking away from us, or joggers and cars, know where we are and that we're approaching with three pups in tow.We purchased three colors, so each dog would be represented by a different color (red, green, blue). We walk about 45 minutes most nights, and these lights are vibrant and visible. They're also lightweight and easily clipped on - didn't seem the bother the dogs at all.It's been a few months - the green is still glowing at full force, the red died out a bit ago, and the blue was the first to go. Granted, it just means we need a battery replacement - but felt it was worth noting! :) Also, unlike another reviewer, we had no troubles with these turning themselves off or on. On the contrary, the buttons were almost so hard to push on all three that we felt it was a perk: No accidental chance our skittish dog could ever turn his off if he got away and bolted at a fast pace!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2012", "summary": "Purchased Three Colors, Loved them All."}

I'm currently using them for the third time - the first time, three years ago with a male Westie; the second two years ago with a female Scotty; and at the moment with a male Cesky Terrier. You may ask me why, if I'm not entirely satisfied with the pads, have I continued to use them? And the answer is: They're better than the alternative - particularly if the alternative is newspaper.My reluctance to give the pads a five star endoresement goes mostly to the manufacturer's claim that their \"fresh grass scent\" somehow promotes house breaking. That has not been my experience. I will concede that terriers are notoriously hard to house break - it took almost a year for our Scotty to get it right without fail - but putting that aside, nothing about their \"scent\" seems to attract a puppy. What is important is \"place.\" You have to make sure that they are in the same place, each and every time - and of course, as you learn your pup's \"restroom signals\" and schedule, you need to take him/her outside as often as possible.But like I said, the pads beat newspaper, hands down. They are much more absorbent, easier to handle, and much less likely to \"soak\" through, (they also don't transfere ink to your carpet as newspaper sometimes does). And while a used pad is not odor free, there is some mitigation of smell.A tip on prices: Check Amazon carefully. For some reason, there are large variations in price, depending on the vendor and package size. The 80-count package is often a substantial savings when compared to the other sizes.[An Up-date: 9/13/2012 - I just thought that I'd add a couple of comments concerning the \"soaking through\" issue that many recent reviewers have raised. I'm sure that people are honestly reporting their experience, but mine has not been the same. Sherlock - my male Cesky and the youngest of my three terriers - is now three years old and fully house broken, but I still keep an area \"padded up\" so the dogs have a spot where they can go in \"emergencies.\" Each of my dogs weighs in at about 22 pounds and if they've had to \"hold it\" for awhile, each of them can produce a copious amount of pee - and I've never had a pad soak through. I'm not sure why some reviewers have found that the pads can't handle a \"three pound Yorkie\" - it may have something to do with how long the pad sits, after it's been used - not more than a couple of hours at my house. I guess the bottom line is that if you're in the market for puppy pads, Nature's Mircle is a pretty good product - and at the price of an 80-count bag you can probably afford to check 'em out for yourself.]", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2009", "summary": "Not a \"Miracle,\" But They Beat the Alternative"}

I suggest making the holes on the top and inbetween the blue top covers be a bit bigger. Most cats have larger paws and they can't get they paw into the openings like they can other models. The other model I have for example they can push there paw in and stretch it far to push the ball & with this one they cannot! I think thats why they are not as intersted. I have tried everything!

The Defuser had helped the anxiety for the second male somewhat.But, then I saw the ad for the Calming Collar and decided to give it a try.  Both my husband and I have noticed AMAZING results in our second male cat.  He's much more calmer, loving and affectionate than before.

He's much more affectionate to our dog, too.The flexible plastic collar is coated with a really nice lavender scent in a powdery form.

Grant", "helpful": [42, 43], "unixReviewTime": 1361750400, "reviewText": "I purchased this product instead of the Cat Stop Ultrasonic Cat Repeller that I have bought in the past.  I have a feral cat issue in my yard and thanks to Oregon feral cat programs I have little to say about this cat's freedom.  I have tried to work with the owners but that did not resolve the issue.  I had two Cat Stop devices and thought I'd try (mostly desperation) a concentrated effort of the two in the corner normally occupied by this cat.  I have no real animosity toward the cat but I don't attract birds to my yard to be killed by a cat.  The concentrated effort seemed to do the trick but this cat decided he'd stake out a new spot in the yard.  I went to buy another Cat Stop device and saw this one on Amazon and liked the reviews and tried it out.  I like it better for three reasons.  First, it uses a metal stake that is screwed to the body.  The Cat Stop is all plastic and it is hard to get the stake into dry ground (yes it is dry occasionally in Oregon) without damaging the stake or the clips that hold the extended stake.  The metal stake is easier to install into the ground and being screwed to the body I feel it is more sturdy and less likely to snap.  Second, I like that the battery compartment has a rubber seal and the cover is screwed to the unit.  One of the Cat Stop covers was blown off the unit--by a leaf-blower or wind.  I'm not sure how but I will give Comtech credit for replacing that while it was under warranty.  However I feel it can potentially happen again and I'd have to pay for the replacement.  The lack of a seal around the compartment door also makes it susceptible to moisture (i.e. Oregon when it isn't dry).  Yes, it is a little more difficult to do a quick battery change but I feel that works for me and will keep the battery from shorting out or getting damaged by wet or the loss of the battery door.  Lastly the unit has a variety of settings to adjust the strength of the unit.  The Cat Stop doesn't have that option.  Overall I feel it is a superior buy and it has the advantage of being less expensive.  The only fault I will give to the company is a lack of documentation with the device that helps determine the settings you might start with for various purposes.  The first one I bought does seem to keep the feral cat at bay.  This is #4 for my yard (#2 Pestbye brand).  Yes, it is annoying to have to spend more and more money to keep my yard my own and my birds protected from a nuisance cat but I'm glad there is a product that works and allows me the option to keep my yard cat-free.  Thank you, Pestbye and Amazon.Update (3/27/2013) - #4 seems to be doing as well as #3 (Pestbye).  I saw the feral cat once since I put up the device.  I went out and increased the sensitivity and I haven't seen the cat since (in my yard).  The yard behind my yard has a good neighbor fence (so people tell me it is called) where you can view the yard at the right angle looking through the spaced boards.  I can see the cat moving around there.  These owners also feed birds but apparently don't concern themselves with the cat roaming their yard.  I mention this because the feral cat is that close to my yard but doesn't visit it.  I've seen him close to the fence and watched to see if he would come over.  He did visit once while I was out of town.  I saw him the day I came back (before I got #4 Pestbye) and checked the two Cat-Stop units.  One had stopped working which could explain why he wasn't bothered as much since the concentrated effort of the two seemed required for that model to work effectively on this cat.  I've notice since I have set up this system with the two concentrated Cat-Stop units and the individual Pestbye units on a fairly high setting that I don't see ANY cats in the backyard.  I do see cats in the front part but not in the back.  I have to attribute their avoidance of the back area to the units.  I'm considering a fifth unit to put in the front.  I have a good row of rhododendrons that I've heard is a popular cat litter box for the neighborhood due to the amount of cat droppings seen when a leaf blower is used to clean out that area.  I'd like to discourage the neighbor cats from using that area for their bathroom.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013", "summary": "Better price and better construction"}

Of course, that means to mount it - it's gonna require mounting it on something sturdy as well otherwise the weight alone will pull it down.  Everything needed to mount it is also included.  Also, note it is weather resistant, not weather proof - meaning it would be best to install under an eve, etc. to keep out of direct rain, snow, etc.  I think the pic is great.  I really like how you can easily walk around the house and take the little monitor (referred to as owners unit) with you (pocket maybe?) - then you can use it's little kickstand to prop it wherever you want to sit it for monitoring.  It has a rechargeable battery, so mobility is not an issue.The camera can be controlled from the monitor (owners unit).  It can be zoomed in and out and actually turned up, down, left and right.  A little con of zooming in and out does require hitting the menu button and actually choosing 1x or 2x zoom - so the zooming feature is not really anything to write home about so to speak.  The menu also offers a way to brighten the display, which is a nice option.  You can also add 3 more cameras to the owners unit.  If you purchase/add the indoor pet camera with sound, you can actually use the microphone talk option to speak via the monitor and transmit to the camera.  This system did not come with the indoor pet unit, so I can not review that portion.  Also, some have mentioned they were able to monitor sound?  All I can hear from the speaker via the owners unit is static - I have not observed any &#34;realtime or real life&#34; sound.?  I just assumed the outdoor camera did NOT have any sound?

There isn't anything but a fresh scent of walnuts. No perfumes nor enhancers. We don't have any cat odors permeating our house, and I keep both boxes in our pantry right next to our kitchen. I don't clean it every day either, but I still don't smell anything like I have before. When I do clean it, I don't smell anything then either. I have used litters that gagged me and made my eyes run. Not so with Blue.I learned that it needs to absorb urine for it to clump well. When it does, it really is more like a slab of clumping, and it is not wasteful. It also does not stick to the bottom or sides nor does it turn to mush. I do have to scrape just a little to remove it from the bottom of the pan. But it isn't like some I've used that ended up like concrete that I had to, literally, pry loose ending up with sore shoulders, hands and wrists. I also like the fact that there is hardly any dust and it does not track all over our furniture, floors or carpets. I am not having to sweep all the time. One time, we were using one that ended up in our bed! Yuck!The clincher was when I saw our old Mr. Persnickety using it. He is so particular about his litter, he was peeing and pooing all over the house. I think he likes the feel of this Blue under his feet. It is more like a soft sand rather than pokey.What else caused me to switch from corn litters is, our Blue is allergic to it and ends up blocked + some reviewers were complaining about bugs. I finally figured out what was causing Blue's problem. He and our Kit took to Blue right away. I had been combining it and the WB litter. No more. Now it's straight Blue litter. I left the combined corn and Blue in a separate box. They all took to the Blue.I will never use any other litter as long as we have cats. I finally found one that lives up to it's promise and I'm sticking with it. (Pardon the pun.) I hope they never stop making this litter. Please keep it on the market. As far as price, it may seem a little spendy, but it is healthier for your cats, you, and your home. I just add a little more every other day to keep a 3\" level. In the long run, it still is cheaper than litters that clump so much, you end up changing out the boxes more often, which, when it is all figured, is costing you more.I, highly, recommend you try the New Improved Blue Naturally Fresh Multi-Cat Clumping Litter if you have more than one cat.

The heats getting more intense and generally when it starts getting over 70 degrees our black Mastiff starts to heat up, he's 9 months and over 100 lbs. When he's uncomfortable at night he doesn't sleep and I don't sleep. He goes as far as sitting in the bathtub barking until I hose him off when the last shower cooling ended. I researched and reviewed reviews last night and bought this to be delivered today and had in on him in 10 minutes. At first he wasn't thrilled and then as soon as he started cooling down, the excessive panting and general discomfort stopped and he just laid down and napped like a king.So far Pro's (for XL in terms of sizing review)- Both sides of the vest have adjustable straps, at 100 lbs I had to pull the straps in a lot for a better fit but there's more than enough room to adjust so as he gets bigger he'll still fit in it comfortably. I was really happy with the amount of room for his deep chest and the length is perfect. The straps even pulled in for a better fit still sit past his rib cage.- After 4 hours of putting it on him the vest still cool and he's still cool-Extremely easy to put on - out of the box, run it under cold water - wring it out really well and just put it on your dog.Cons - none so far, it looks like a jacket but it's not a jacket, so if you get any flack about having a jacket on your dog in the summer simply inform that person it's a cooling vest or ignore the comment. It's for the dog, not you.I will update after a few months but otherwise our Mastiff is much much more comfortable now and back on his couch and out of my bathtub.UPDATE: July 1, 2014Still giving it 5 stars - it's not built for humid days or environments but still great for IL weather.

After gradually taming her, she (Goose) has become completely enamored with our large German Shepherd. Even though she must be at least 3-4 years old now, she plays with the crazy, wild abandon of a small kitten.  Chasing the dog and climbing furniture are her favorite pasttimes.  In order to save the furniture, I'd recently priced some of the large cat climbing structures; and I found that to buy a large, sturdy one is well over $150.We already had plenty of scrap lumber in our workshop; so I used 3/4\" thick MDF to make a wide square base and then securely bolted a 4\"x4\" post in the middle.  I covered the base with some leftover carpet scraps; and I'm currently in the process of wrapping the 4x4 post tightly with the sisal rope.  I brush a very thin layer of adhesive on sections of the post as I'm wrapping it, and then every 7-8 inches, I tack in a small nail through the sisal rope into the post.  During all this wrapping, my hyper kitty is stalking me and attacking the post and swaying rope.  Apparently, she's having trouble waiting for her Christmas gift.  I haven't yet decided what will go on top of the post (simple platform or sleeping box?) or how tall to make the post.  It's cut right now at 6' but I may cut it shorter.  If I leave it at a taller height like that, I'll have to secure it to the wall somehow in order to keep it upright during exuberant play.  I have to hurry up though...Goose is getting impatient.It's always nice to have other uses for products.  Since I'll have leftover sisal rope (I bought 2), I'm also making some of the small, old-fashioned sisal bottle-brush Christmas trees (found a great tutorial online).  I'm making them in assorted sizes and will leave some of them the natural sisal color and will dye some of the others.  Pretty cool.For both of these projects, I've been very happy with the quality of this sisal rope.  I had checked at 2 different home improvement and hardware stores, and their sisal ropes had a very strong unpleasant solvent-type odor.  This rope has a bit of a smell, but it's more of a subtle straw or dried-grass odor.  Nothing unpleasant.  I would have given a 5 rating; but I feel that the price is rather high.  I guess you just have to pay extra for non-stinky rope.UPDATE:  Wrapping the 6 foot tall 4x4 post tightly required nearly two packages of this sisal rope.  I finished Goose's climbing tree with a simple carpet-covered platform on top, as well as three smaller carpet-covered ledges spaced randomly up the post.

The 24\" fixture is over my mostly fish-only marine tank, with just a couple of \"easy\" corals (a kenya tree and a colony of palythoas). My 20 gallon is a generic pet store tank with a standard rectangular shape and a 20\" depth. Prior to the Aquatic Life, I had theFinnex Ray2 Aquarium Day/Actinic LED Light. The Finnex 24\" boasted a pretty staggering 192 LEDs while this fixture only has 57, which probably accounts for the feeling that this fixture is much less \"bright\" than the Finnex - however it is a 20 watt versus 36.So to answer the general questions of \"will this be good enough to keep my corals alive/thriving?\" - unfortunately my answer here is sort of incomplete.  All I can say is that, so far, all of my corals are alive and healthy and it hasn't encouraged the growth of cyanobacteria.What about if you have a fish-only tank and you're not really worried about PAR ratings for corals?  Well, the Aquatic Life fixture includes both 10k lights and moonlights, but also a band of lights including a couple of red LEDs.  You can individually select this band and turn it off, but it diminishes quite a bit of the overall power of the strip. If you're running a planted or fish-only freshwater, I think this would work just fine. However, if you're used to only 10k and actinic in a marine set up, you may not like the aesthetic the red band brings. It took me a couple of days to get used to it, but I actually think it helps many of the greens and yellows \"pop\" a bit more than they used to under just the 10k/actinic.As for the functionality, I really wish all of the bells and whistles included on this fixture was more common. You have three basic channels - blue/moonlight, white lights, and white/red/mix, and each channel can be set on a simple timer function. If I could do a \"wishlist\" request, it would be for the ability to do on/off times multiple times a day, but as it is, it's still more than most fixtures give you the ability to do. Some sort of battery backup would also be nice - I plugged the light in multiple times when I was setting it up (testing it, testing it on the tank, final location setup) and I had to reset the clock and the timer each time. If you live in an area prone to brownouts, I can see this getting annoying fast.Aesthetics - in my opinion, it looks nice. The fixture itself is a very slick and simple black aluminum body. Unlike many other LED aquarium lights, there's not a lot of extraneous \"light bleed\" since the light sits very low atop the aquarium itself (the feet are only about an inch long). My tank is a generic black-rimmed tank, but I think this would look fine even sitting above a rimless. Also unlike many other lights, the feet are securely locked into place by a friction screw - whereas other lights like the ones made by Finnex use a plastic bit that can freely slide around.Conclusion - Like on my bigger 55g, I'm going to run this alone for a while and monitor the fish and corals. I really don't expect anything drastic to occur in the meantime and I may even try running both the Finnex and the Aquatic Life for a while - although that may simply be too much light.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2014", "summary": "Not bad on my 20 gal, but feels dimmer than my old Finnex Ray2"}

My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs.\" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2012", "summary": "Terrible cat food"}

She likes the regular A&H; multi-cat, so I didn't think this would be a big stretch for her. This is very different from multi-cat, but she seems to be accepting it. The thing I really don't like about this is the fragrance. It is a weird fruity/floral scent and it is kind of strong. My husband thought I lit a scented candle when he came home, and that was a few hours after I first opened it. Needless to say, I am not a scented candle kind of person. I think the cats and I will have to get used to the texture, too. It is like very fine sand. Despite the claim, I really don't believe this product is low tracking compared to the old one. I happen to have a box with the old litter right next to one with Clump & Seal (in case the one cat refuses it), and there seems to be just as much Clump & Seal as there is multi-cats on my floor. I think Clump and Seal will be harder to clean up, too. I'm about to find out as soon as I'm done with my review, so wish me luck. Odor control is only slightly better, if at all. I never had a problem with odor, though. I am a stay-at-home mom so I am able to clean the boxes out ASAP. I never noticed odor with the multi-cats even if we were out all day and came home to a dirty litter box, except right after the fact. Even with clump & seal, there is noticeable odor at first, so I doubt the \"seal\" part of their claims.A good thing is that the dust from pouring is greatly reduced. I hated inhaling litter dust, and I can't say that I have noticed any dust with this. Clumping is a bit better than multi-cats, but not so greatly so that I would pay much more for this than multi-cats.This product is something I would buy if it was cheaper than our regular brand, but I certainly wouldn't pay more for it. If you like scented candles and dust is a real problem, you would probably really like this.Edit 6-7-14. We stopped using it after the first box. It turns out that the picky cat never used this and the other cat couldn't care less what litter was used. There is a weird smell to this after it has been out a while, even though the box is cleaned out at least once a day. I guess I would call it sour, but it is hard to explain. It is definitely harder to clean up off the wood floor and carpet compared to regular litter. I'm assuming it is because of the smaller grains. The texture also makes it impossible to completely clean out of the litter box. There are always these tiny \"crumbs\" that slip right through the litter scoop. Between the odd scent, the \"crumbs\", the difficulty cleaning up, and the sour smell, this isn't worth it. And now that I have read that cats are getting sick from ingesting this litter when it sticks to their paws, this isn't coming into my house even if I was getting paid to use it. I would much prefer a cloud of litter dust in my face.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2014", "summary": "Like a fine sand mixed with a scented candle"}

However, this is only the case when it's working, though it's only the biowheel that is faulty and outdated.The biowheel on these older models turns as water is ejected out of the filter. However, within a few days (maybe week and a half) the filter either starts to slow down or the wheel gets stuck against the cover because it stops turning.If you bought this item you probably bought it for the mechanical, chemical, and bio filtration it supposedly offers. However, about half of the time you'll end up with just chemical and mechanical, as the bio filtration ceases when the wheel stops to function.Still, the filter itself is an awesome piece of machinery and it is otherwise well built. Aside from the bio filtration, every other method of filtration works just great (though the filter pads could come with a bit more carbon).I've had my 30 gallon aquarium for 3 years now and the Penguin 150 has been with me since day one. During the middle of my second year with it I bought an Emperor 280 (also by marineland) to work along with the Penguin 150. I believe the Emperor models is what the Penguin was supposed to have accomplished, except the Emperor models are a lot better. The wheel does not rely on the flow of the water being ejected from the filter and instead has a hose like tube spraying water on it causing it to turn. The Emperor also has larger filter pads and comes with an extra slot in which you can add whatever type of chemical filtration you want (also holds a large amount which is a big plus). If you're looking at the Penguin models I strongly urge you to consider an Emperor model. They are a bit more expensive and a bit larger but they are incredibly effective. If you have a tank about my size, though, you're going to have to cut the intake tube as it is a lot longer than the Penguin models.Anyway, I decided to write this because I'm getting sick of my Penguin 150 and I'm about to retire it for a HOT Magnum also by Marineland.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2009", "summary": "Outdated"}

No fish!  I've got a rock in there, and a bunch of guppy grass for the shrimp to graze on.  For the filter, I do not use the under gravel filter it came with.  I use a sponge filter so the shrimp can graze on that.Now the incandescent light it came with is terrible.  I did not like its yellow color and the heat from incandescents.  So I bought a LED bulb, but that too was too yellow and too dim!!  I even glued aluminum foil to the inside of the lid housing which helped a little but not that much.  Finally I found a bulb here on amazon that was perfect!  It's the &#34;E12 6 Watt LED Bulb 27 SMD 5630 LEDs omnibearing Lighting cool White 5000K&#34; by SZHuibang sold by CCC International.  It's $9 with shipping.  The bulb looks big but it will fit.  You have to remove the clear plastic panel on the lid of the aquarium and put the bulb in that way.  The lighting difference was like night and day!  And there is very little heat.  Hopefully it will last long because I am setting this up for my mom for mother's day.So for my purposes, this tank was fine.  I have tried with fish but I think 1 gallon is just too small, except maybe for a betta.In terms of what the tank comes with&#8230;the bulb and the undergravel filter are just junk IMHO.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2014", "summary": "Great for the Right Application BUT Needs Some Work!"}

They are carnivores, not omnivores, even though theydo like to eat grasses).The way we use Blue Buffalo is as their treats. For many years, our cats were getting Temptations as their treats.They couldn't get enough of them, and would beg, rub on the drawer they were kept in to get them, even digging the emptybags out of the trash. Well, once we read up on the ingredients, we were shocked to find the garbage we'd been feeding to ourcats! It has the equivalent of kitty MSG in there, which is why they love them so much. (Think bags of flavored potato chips forhumans - you can't stop eating them for a reason!)So, we couldn't do that to our cats anymore. We'd also noticed other thing, like itchy skin, hyperness, etc.We no longer give them their old treats, and have instead used Blue Buffalo. They like it just as much.We have one of those treat balls (also purchased from Amazon!), which we fill up with Blue Buffalo. The cats adore it,roll the ball around to get their snack fix, and we know it is still very good for them. Both of our cats arechicken-holics, preferring chicken over all other meat or fish flavors. This food fills their happy spot!We have not yet replaced any formal dry meals with this food, but I would certainly not have a problem doing that.It is a nice size kibble for the cats as well, with the latest formulation being smaller than the other versions.(The other life bits were pretty big - these are smaller and easier for cats to chew.)All in all, as a long-time cat owner and fanatic, this is a really great food to give to them.
