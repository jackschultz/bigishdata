That one is okay for quick trips around town, but my son fell asleep in it a couple times and his head fell in some very awkward positions and he hates anything longer than 30 minutes.

We drove from San Antonio to Houston (about 4 hours) and my son slept nearly the whole way down and then back on the return. This seat is made to be very comfortable, the head rests on both sides stick out quite a ways so he is able to lean on them and the seat is made so that it reclines deeper than a normal carseat. We put some toys in his cupholder which was convenient for him to get to them and he was content and happy for most of the ride. This is significantly different from his other toddler seat in the other car, so we are quite happy about the change.If you have to be in the car a lot for long commutes on a regular basis, this is a great seat!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2014", "summary": "Comfy!"}

One thing that took my husband a while to catch on to (and I mean a year) is when you put a diaper in to push it only to where those griper things are. This way you can get the best twist and seal it in completely. When he was a baby I use to wait until there was 2 diapers (at the start of a freshly cut liner) so they could be gripped together.

It is not our favorite swim diaper. We like the gender-neutral pattern so we can use the diaper if our next child is a boy, but the design has some challenges...Here are some notes to consider:It's very hard to get the Velcro straps off--they really need a pull-tab to help us get them undone. Instead, it's a two-handed and very awkward job that annoys our daughter during a time she's already uncomfortable--wet and cold. After we get our daughter out of the pool, we would love to be able to just slip off the diaper and take her into the shower with us to clean off the chlorine. However, since the Velcro tabs are so tough to undo, we have to take her somewhere soft to lie her down to get the tabs undone--or it's a two-person job at the shower door.Also, the Velcro tabs and hemming seem to chafe her skin slightly, as she has red marks when we remove the diaper. I'd love a softer hemming so that her delicate skin doesn't get irritated--the water makes it more sensitive, after all.The fabric is not typical swimsuit material. Instead, it's almost like a tightly-woven upholstery fabric. As a result, it holds a big puddle of water when we lift her from the water. It takes a moment to let her drip dry before we can hold her in our arms--unless we are prepared to get ourselves and our towels drenched. So, basically we use an extra towel to catch the water that pools in her bottom, that towels gets drenched, then we use a fresh dry towel to dry her off. We didn't have this water pooling issue with other swim diapers.The fabric has held its color and seems very durable, which is awesome since we are using it in chlorine water. Standard swimsuit fabric tends to lose its elasticity when exposed to chlorine after awhile and I can tell this suit will hold up.All in all, I'd recommend this diaper. Just know you'll have to have patience and an extra towel when you use it.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2013", "summary": "Makes transitioning from the pool tricky, but great colors!"}

You can then keep the food in the fridge for up to 48hrs or freeze it up to 3 months.I like a lot of things about this:- it's very easy to clean if you do it right away,- it's small to store (they recommend keeping the box for this, I absolutely agree),- the food pouches take a lot less room than ice trays or other containers,- it's easy to use, and- it comes with a handy magnetic sticker to remind you of the food storage times.But I think there's room for improvement:- the funnel-things have three marks but no information about what they mean. I assume each is 1oz, but can't be sure. I fill them to the third line and my pouches are almost full,- the squeze-thing tends to leave some food behind if you fill the funnels above the third line.- the pouches are NOT microwave safe; to thaw and warm up the food you have to place the pouch in warm water, which then cools and you have to change for more warm water until it's done, but some foods separate into liquid/solids and then I have to use the food processor or blender to make them uniform again. In my experience, this problem doesn't occur if you microwave the food directly from the freezer.

That means that there's no chance of milk  or condensation backing up into the tubing, causing mold, mildew, and other contamination, as can happen with the Medela.3. This is fairly quiet.  All pumps are loud - that's just the nature of the beast.  This isn't loud enough to be disruptive, though.  I pump at work in a small conference room, and the people sitting in cubicles right next to it can't hear it.  I've also pumped at home while on the phone and the only person who recognized the sound was my sister, a fellow pumper.  No one else has mentioned hearing anything.4. I've yet to use their customer service, but I have heard it's awesome.  In contrast, I tried to get help with my Medela pump when it lost suction and they told me too bad, buy another one.  That's how I ended up with the Ameda in the first place.5. Cost!  It's significantly less expensive than a Medela.  Both come highly recommended by lactation consultants, so why spend the extra?6. This has two dials - one for speed and one for suction strength.  You can adjust both along the whole dial instead of just having 3 set points on each.  I like this because you can finely tune it to your specific needs.  I turn the speed all the way up to trigger letdown, then slow it down to more quickly empty my breasts.  The suction is excellent, too.  I only have to turn it about halfway up for sufficient suction.  Please note also that higher suction does NOT mean more milk.  Milk is released by the letdown reflex, which has more to do with speed and your mental state than suction.  Many one star reviews say the suction is bad, which is untrue, but more importantly irrelevant.  You will not get more milk with higher suction.  That's just not how the human body works.Cons:Medela parts are more readily available at virtually any big-box store (Target, Meijer, Wal-Mart, etc.).  I've only seen Ameda parts at Babies R Us or on Amazon.  This isn't a con for me since I prefer to shop online, but many don't.  It would be nice to be able to run down the street for a replacement valve instead of waiting to have it shipped.  I solved that issue by always having a couple extra on hand.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 8, 2013", "summary": "Quality product for a great price"}

Several people thought is was amazing that I actually brought a seat for my child instead of using the restaurant's high chair. I would pack a bib and baby spoon between the white tray and the green lid.  I have seen a  few other moms jealous that I have this seat!  My husband's cousin asked if he could have my son's booster seat, because they liked it so much and they never thought of buying it or he is too cheap to spend $20.00!So now my son is almost two and I have taken off the tray, and the green backrest and he uses it as a booster seat at the table.

We had an older Rainforest jumperoo that was given to us that he LOVED, but we wanted another one so he could have one at home and the babysitters house. We chose this one because of all the features and toys it had on it and I liked the fact that it was educational as well (sings ABC's and teaches colors and animals, ect). When we put Caleb in it for the first time he didn't seem to happy and the lowest setting was a little tall for him still (he is 25 in long) so we would put a thin pillow or blanket underneath him to help out and he would go to town jumping away. Also, with the rainforest jumper, he would put his arms down in the seat, out of the leg hole and get stuck that way, in this jumperoo, he can't do that, nor does he try, which is great! It's been a few weeks and he no longer needs the added support to reach the floor, but he is still a little confused as to what to do with the toys on it. I am dissapointed with the little pig farm and the cow that's on it. They don't really do anything. I guess with the pigs you are supposed to be able to hit one and the others pop up higher, but they barely move at all so there's really nothing to play with and with the cow, you are supposed to hit a button and he ducks down and then back up, but again, he barely moves, so what a waste. Luckily, the overhead light bar is enough to keep him occupied for a good period of time. He will just sit there and be amazed by the lights. He hasn't quite figured out the flipping of the pages of the book yet, but I am sure he will get there. Lastly, I really like that you can set the music to come on only when they bounce or constantly no matter what. He loves the music, as well as the ABC's and rhymes. Overall, I recommed this jumperoo to all parents out there, and if you don't like this one, get another one because it is truley a lifesaver when you need a freehand for a few minutes and sometimes for 30 mins or more.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 2, 2010", "summary": "Baby loves it!!"}

If you size up, the neck and arm holes will be too big and your baby will be lost in the sack.This is my favorite sleep sack partially because it is designed to fit babies more snugly ... not so much extra (and unnecessary) fabric for the baby to tangle in.The main reason this sack is my favorite, though, is because it has a two-way zipper that makes dressing and diapering my daughter a DREAM compared with the regular top-down only zipper sacks (all the other brands, from what I can tell ... I've got 2 other brands).  With a top-down only zipper, getting my fussy baby into this thing before bed is a challenge, to say the least.  With this, though, No Problem!Of course, the fact that this is so soft and snuggly doesn't hurt any.  I wouldn't mind having one of these in my size!  :)The only drawback I found to this sack is that the neck hole isn't V-ed at all to keep the bulky fabric away from the baby's face area.  I was worried that this might get in the way of our daughter's mouth while she was little tiny, so I didn't start using this until she was 3+ months old.  Now that she's a bit larger and has more control of her neck I feel okay leaving her in it.  Anyway, this is partially why you would definitely not want to size up on this sack ... you want the sack to be pretty well fitted around the neck and shoulders.The lack of a V neck-line is the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5.

My 6-month-old baby only recently started eating solid foods, so I wanted to buy a few things to experiment with. It has great reviews, so I gave it a shot. Plus, I love that this comes with the food mill and little food sucker thing combined...two things to try and the package is affordable.Here are my findings:Food processor...First: how it works: Basically, it's two pieces (more if you unscrew all the parts). You put the food, like a banana, in the cylinder of the main piece and you put that cylinder on top of the plunger. You then apply downward pressure to the cylinder while cranking the mill. As you do this, the food is churned through small holes in the top of the cylinder and retained in a small basin. You then Scoop the food into your storage device, like a bowl. I scooped mine into infantino pouches.--If you're processing a hard food, like pineapple, you really have to push down hard on the cylinder. This can be uncomfortable for the wrists, as it's a sideways push for the wrists due to the angle. It would be great to have a little handle to help with leverage.--Some foods don't strain as easily as others. For example, banana comes right on through while pineapple does not.--You have to take the whole thing apart to clean...including unscrewing the crank. It's a pain for a simple product.The food processor is great. I wasn't sure how it would work because I'd never used one before, but it's fast and easy. There's a lot to clean up though. I'm glad to have this in our kitchen, even if it's not an everyday item.Now, the food pouch...I put pineapple in this and my daughter went nuts. She loves it.

However, when I got home, she immediately ran toward the the booster and took her seat at the table like a big girl. I actually feel she is safer sitting on the Cooshee than on a plastic booster strapped to the chair because it \"sticks\" to the chair and she can't slip off the seat. The Cooshee easily fits under the table, and doesn't look like an eyesore; actually, you can't even tell it's on the chair unless you really look for it.My daughter is constantly carrying her cooshee around the house and has used it to sit on the floor, jump/stand on, and as a bed for her \"babies.\" Talk about versitile! :) With all that wear and tear, the cooshee still looks great and is super easy to clean.

I left the tags on my bag for a few days while I decided if it was really worth the large fee I paid. Deciding just to treat myself and go for it, I removed the tags and took it on my first real outing - and was SEVERELY disappointed. The biggest issue is that the seatbelt-like straps slip off the shoulder; there is absolutely no grip. I'll have to make something for it, myself, which should not be the case with something in this price range. Secondly, while the fold out diaper changing area is cool for tiny infants, it ends up being a waste of space once your child is beyond 6 or 8 months old. This is because there is no other exterior pocket - the entire thing is comprised of the fold out changing pad. When you no longer need a changing pad, you can't substitute other useful things in that space. Next, the exterior bottle pockets are just a smidge too tight for my Target- purchased toddler cups (I have an infant and a 3 y.o.) and while I applaud that the bag is generally larger than many others on the market it's not THAT much larger - and with the absence of exterior pockets, all of your stuff has to be stacked on top of each other inside. It makes locating that certain toy just that much more difficult in a pinch. My husband hates the bag because the backpack straps have large clasps on it that poke him when he carries it from the house to the car. Overall, it just really wasn't worth the money.

Defeats the purpose... the VTech monitor has adjustable sensitivity, so I was able to set it so it ignored the air purifier, it really does just kick on when she makes noise.2. Vibration alert - When she *really* starts to get noisy, it vibrates to alert you, great if you have it turned down really low, or if you're asleep. Its helps to get your attention.3. Talk - I can speak to her through the parent unit. I haven't really used this much yet, but my husband finds it fun to use when I'm in her room with her, he likes to make funny voices to her, which she finds really amusing.4. Range - This has excellent range, I've never had it go out of range, no annoying warning beeps.5. Battery level - The old monitor was analog, and I never new when the battery was low until it was just about dead.

Also, the newel was about 3\" wide, which looked too large forY Spindle for Gate Installation (2 Pack) from KidCoor Safety Innovations GM6 Baluster Mounting Kit by Safety Innovations.This product worked great after installation on the square and round parts of the newel. The pressure-mounted gate is secure against it (and the manufacturer claims that it also works with gates that would otherwise be screwed into a wall).However, installation took about 30 minutes, which could have been shorter if the trilingual (English, Spanish, French) instructions had been better.  You can see the instructions (aka \"user guide\") at the Kidco Web site.  It has the following problems: (1) The font is quite small. (2) It has no diagrams of the 10 types of parts (clamp fronts, clamp backs, bolts, wood blocks, shims, round post adapters, finish washers, 1-1/2\" screws, 1-3/4\" screws, and a 36\"x1\"x2\" wood piece). These would have been especially helpful for people who are not mechanically inclined, or for people whose first language is not English, espa&ntilde;ol, or franais. (3) It does not specify what tools are needed for installation: a Phillips screwdriver (to attach the clamps to the baluster), a level (to make the 36\" wood piece perpendicular to the floor), a drill with 5/32\" bit (to connect the 36\" wood piece to the wood blocks inside the clamps), and a saw and sandpaper (if the 36\" wood piece needs to be cut shorter). (4) The pictures for Figure 2 and Figure 4 are swapped.

So, I would have to take the stopper out for him to drink from it, which always led to a mess.I haven't had any issues with the nipples on the cups, and we've only had very minor spills/leaks with the cups, which have usually come from my son biting the spout.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cup is so large that my son can't hold it on his own (he's 11 months now). He didn't have a problem with the cups with two side handles, but this cup is to large for him to easily hold and use at this point. I think that by the time he could hold it that he will have moved on to a more advanced cup.Pros: Dishwasher safeEasy for baby to get the hang ofMostly spill-proofCons: Hard for baby to handle on his own*Update 1/28/11* I think that my son just needed time to get used to the cup.

My 3yr old (37\" and 29lbs) says that she is comfortable in this stroller.  I feel it's good as a store umbrella stroller because:1) It does not shake at all unlike my Combi. You can really get this stroller moving.2) It's really easy to fold up, unless you have flip flops on... then you need to be careful when closing.3) Turns great.  The front wheels do not get hung up and stuck when turning (Combi does).4) The stroller does not get stuck if there's a crack in the sidewalk (Combi).  Very smooth ride for me as I do not have to fight the stroller.5) Sun shade is too, too, too small.  There is a wide opening in the back, even with the seat in the full upright position, which allows sun to hit my very fair daughter.  I purchased a Ray Shade from Babies R Us for $15.99 to keep the sun out.  May not be a problem with a smaller child, but for a 37\" child it is.6) There is no cup holder for the kid.  I purchased one from Babies R Us for $7.99 because my daughter is used to having one (Combi) and I don't want to be stuck in the loop of taking her cup out of the parent cup holder, giving it to her, and then putting it back into the parent cup holder over and over again.7) There are NO mesh pockets.  I checked the entire box, opened from both ends, and there are no mesh pockets any where.  I called the company and even though there are no mesh pockets pictured here or on their website, the stroller is supposed to have them so they are sending them to me.  Great customer service!8) The bottom basket is decent remembering that this is an umbrella stroller and not a full size stroller.  I am also able to put my reusable grocery bags around both handles which balances the weight nicely.9) Does not fully recline.  I would consider the decline to be just leaning back versus laying down.Overall, a good umbrealla stroller for $51.00 plus the $24 in accessories for it.  So much better than Combi.

Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak. NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby's face. Not only do you have to clean up but your baby doesn't want to wait for a new bottle. After slowly running out of bottles that didn't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect! They don't leak and our baby has less gas. The liners prevent a lot of gas. If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price. You get 100 of them for maybe $5.00. We haven't had any problems with leaking at all.So I don't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time. But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer, warmer, & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that doesn't mean they are all bad.

I bought it without trying it in my car (bad idea -- I got lucky that it fit). I've got a 2009 Toyota RAV4 and we used this carseat from when my child was a newborn (we never had a infant bucket-type carseat). This seat fit her well as a newborn because of the extra padding and the fact that the headrest could be removed so the seat could be reclined enough even in a relatively small backseat. (This seat is wide though -- if you're trying to do side by side carseats, the removal cupholder will help, but with the width, I'm not sure it would work).The rebound control is a nice safety feature that is still reasonably hard to find -- my child also likes to kick the rebound control for fun :) She's overall been quite happy in the seat -- she can fall asleep without much head slump but is high enough to see.Installation was relatively straightforward once we figured out the LATCH locations in my car -- we were able to get a rock solid installation -- we did use one towel to get the angle right (there is an angle indicator that makes figuring out the right angle easy).Only thing I would change about the seat is the rear face weight limit -- it's only 35 lbs versus the 40 other seats have. It is a good seat for tall kids though -- high harness slots. My child is relatively tall and light, so I think she'll hit the height limit before the weight limit. Different child would have been a different story, so again, we got lucky on the fit.Also, buying online, the seat was manufactured a year before I got it, so I have less time before it expires.

Unfortunately, the instructions were extremely difficult and confusing and we never actually did figure out how to turn it into a cosleeper as we had intended. I think it sat half-assembled in our bedroom for several weeks until we could get over the initial frustration and give it another go. We never did figure it out fully, and as it turns out we couldn't have even used it as a cosleeper anyway because our bed was too high and we never got the attachments to raise it up so we just shoved the bassinet version up against our bed and made the best of it. The baby slept soundly in it, though, and we never had an issues with the mattress. We didn't think it was too hard or lumpy the way others have.After our baby outgrew the bassinet (you're really not supposed to keep them in any bassinet once they become even the least bit mobile, so take the reviewers who say their baby flipped and kicked and rolled their way to a dangerous position with a grain of salt) we turned it into a playpen. The biggest problem with it as a playpen is that the foldable mattress folds over the bar running down the middle and basically forms a mountain range that divides the playpen in two and makes it uncomfortable for your baby to play in. My baby never fails to cry when I put her in it (mostly just so I can go to the bathroom - she hates being in there too much for me to just let her play there). She also figured out she can step on the lining that runs from the bottom of the playpen to about 6 inches up and peek her head over the top of the railing. She can't currently get out but she's trying, and I think the way it's designed it's only a matter of time before she manages to topple out.One good feature is that it is very portable, more so than any other playpen I've seen. It folds into a very compact and sturdy box complete with handles. It came in very handy when we went on vacation a few months ago.Despite its problems, I would buy this cosleeper again and would recommend it to friends.

We don't trust hotel cribs and when visiting family or friends who don't have cribs or playards, this has been perfect! She still fits in this co-sleeper.

My parents have the mini co-sleeper and although she can still fit in it when we go to grandma's (our daughter is 16 pounds, 26 inches long now), I don't like using it because with her arms stretched out (like she always sleeps), they touch the sides and this wakes her up. So, I highly recommend if you are between this and the mini, to get this one if you want it to last a while. Her arms could touch the sides of the other at around 4 months. Now, we'll have it set up as a playard in the living room to carry outside in the backyard for summer-time fun! Great product!BTW, you don't have to buy Arms Reach sheets to fit.

BUT, totally worth every penny.  I have purchased a crib sheet, bib, and a few 4-pack 100% cotton muslin swaddles by the same maker and I could not be more satisfied with all of their products.  This blanket feels soooooo good! Some of the things that I absolutely love about it are:1. Soft - very very soft...feels dreamy to the touch.2. Nice weight - Unlike the feathery swaddles, which I also happen to love, this particular blanket is made up of many layers, which gives it a nice weight, yet it is not too heavy that it will pin the baby down and not allow her to move.  She has been sleeping under this blanket for about 5 days now, and I cannot believe how much better she sleeps, both at night and during the day for her naps.  I think the softness and the weight of the blanket really comfort my baby, and she snoozes away peacefully for loooong periods of time!3. Large - although this blanket is quite pricey, it is rather large.  I justified its purchase by convincing myself that she will have this blanket for years to come.  My 4 year old niece loved snuggling underneath it and she is average height for her age, so I will definitely get my $ worth.  Another reason why I love its size is the fact that it keeps my little girl covered at all times.  She loves to turn a lot in her crib and no matter which direction she goes, the blanket stays on her - I don't have to worry about her being cold in the middle of the night while I am out sleeping!4. Breathable - My little girl tends to be pretty clammy most of the time.  She overheats easily and so the last thing I want to do is load her in fleece pj's and cover her with a polyester or another fleece blanket during these winter months.  Granted, we live in southern California, so the temps don't get nearly as low as in other places, but my husband and I sill don't like to use the central heat in our house too much and in worst case scenarios, we do not heat our house past 72F. This blanket keeps our munchkin very warm and cozy.  I like to layer her in a cotton onsie, followed by a cotton one piece pj with footsies and then I cover her with this blanket.  PERFECT! She has been sleeping through the night beautifully, has not overheated, and is not cold...just perfect!  Makes me feel better knowing that her skin is able to breathe in all cotton attire and covered by a cotton blanket.5. Great design - I purchased the Star Light pattern in pink, which is absolutely beautiful.  The image on the site doesn't do it justice.  It is actually much nicer in person, with the circles being nice and vivid colors.All in all, I absolutely love this blanket, my baby LOOOOVES this blanket, my husband even is sold on it even though he was very annoyed by the price, so I no longer feel guilty paying $50.

The bag is fine, but it's bulky to carry as a backpack and you have no choice but to put it on your bag or carry it via a handle (and drag).  One time we were delayed and tried to bring this into an airport bar/restaurant.  While trying to get to our booth, everyone looked at us like we were insane, and kept asking \"What is that on your back?!  It's huge!\"The BRICA Cover Guard tote is preferable to me for two reasons.  The first is obviously the wheels.  Being able to wheel your bag from luggage claim or through the airport is so much easier than wearing the huge item on your back (which is very awkward and hard to navigate crowded spaces in the airport, if you do use your seat on the plane or gate check it).  Also, this tote folds down when not in use.  Both of these features make it a better product for us than the backpack bags.  I really like it and anything that makes travel with a baby or toddler easier is well worth the small investment to do so.  One other tip to my fellow travelers, don't be afraid to put a few small items lightweight but bulky items in with the car seat when you check or gate check these like jackets, blankets, etc.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2013", "summary": "Great product for traveling with convertible car seats"}

One quibble is that even though it is properly installed, the seat can be lifted up about 1 to 1.5 inches at the front, which is enough for little hands to push through, and for small toys to be dropped in.  She can't open it up, and there is no danger of her falling in, but it doesn't completely lock her out of the bowl.Also note that the lock has to be manually pushed down after each use, separately from closing the lid.  It gets to be a habit after a while, but it isn't spring-loaded or in any way attached to the lid, so when you close the lid the lock stays in the fully unlocked position until you push it down and lock it.Overall this is a good, but not great, solution for keeping kids from playing in the bowl.

I was really hesitant to buy a different sippy cup since I tried to buy the least maintenance cup which was the take n toss.

We're on our second car seat now, and I've helped install others for friends, and every car seat has its own installation quirks. At some point, with all of them, if you're using seat belts to hold down the car seat, you're going to have to tighten the belt significantly. When I install our car seat (before the Mighty Tite), that means getting up on it and bearing down a lot of weight while tugging on it; when my wife does it, it means not being able to get a really tight fit at all.\"After\" we got the Mighty Tite, and went through the use of it, I'd say our car seat installation time was reduced by 200%, and the installation job was much more secure. During a recent spate of traveling, we had to install and re-install the seat a dozen times in a two-week period, and this was utterly essential for getting on and off of the airplane quickly while still having a securely-installed seat, and even more importantly, getting the seat re-installed securely when we were putting it into a \"strange\" car.We particularly appreciated the plastic instructions attached to the Mighty Tite with a metal ring -- it meant when we got confused about how to use it with a different belt arrangement, we had the visual reference right at hand and not all dog-eared or ripped up (like our car seat installation manual!)Obviously, if you're only going to install the car seat once in one car there may be diminishing returns on a device like this. But if you have to move it even occasionally, I think this accessory is worth the price for a little extra security and peace of mind, plus a few extra minutes saved.The one caveat I provide is that the plastic retainers that hold the strap in have begun to look a little stressed (the way well-used plastic looks before it breaks), so this might not wear well over a multi-year period. This is not a safety issue, since this part is used only to guide the safety belt, and if it does break, it will still be usable. Still, one would hope it will not!

I can use it with my back to either side, depending on my mood/ desires for support.- It's big, but not too big for a couple in a queen bed.  My husband even likes to snuggle up to the back of it.Cons:- The cover is too tight in one place -- at the inside edge of the top curly-q.  Others have commented on this in other Snoogle reviews.  What this means is that there is a taut, hard seam on that inner edge, and it could easily dig into your neck or shoulder depending on how you sleep on the pillow.  I tried to massage the pillow around to distribute the filling differently, but it didn't help.  And it just gets worse with use, it seems. I think the cover is just too short there.  I don't think I could relieve the tension just by restitching the seam -- I'd probably have to lengthen the cover with an insert there.- The material is not very soft.  It's not bad, but it's not great, either, and requires careful washing in cold water and drying on super-low heat, if at any at all.Overall, I sleep much better with this thing, so I give it 4 stars.

This stroller is definitely great value for the price. I am using it for my 2 year old, but it is big enough to fit my four year old.Weight: This is supposed to be ~12 pounds, but I don't notice that it is any heavier than the G-Lite (9 lbs). It is light enough that I can easily lift it into the trunk of my car and carry it up steps.Construction: This Joovy is significantly more 'solid' looking than the G-Lite. The individual frame pieces are just wider. Its frame are square pieces, not circular, so I wonder if this is why the individual parts are wider.Storage: The storage on this is great. It has a very nice underbasket that is plenty big enough to carry diapers and other supplies. When the seat is in full recline, you can't really reach the storage, however. There is also a small zipper compartment and drink stand inside the canopy. Also, inside the seat, where the kid can reach, are two small 'baskets' about the size of a drink or snack cup on either side of the kid's bottom. This kid drink holder is really a nice feature for toddlers.Canopy: Big full canopy. Plenty of sun coverage. Nice clear panel with flap on top and tie-back so that you can look at your baby.Stearing/breaks: workable. You can lock the front wheels to go straight, which is useful for one-handed pushing of the stroller. The brakes lock in an up position, with a pleasing click sound.Height: This stroller is comfortable for me and my husband to push (5'4&#34; and 6'3&#34;). The handles might be a big high for someone very petite.CONS: If ever Joovy reads this, there are several things that could be improved.- drinks: the drink stand on the back of the canopy is not great. I would much, much rather something that attached to the frame like the drink stand on my old G-Lite. Useless for a drink that doesn't have a spill-proof top.- carry strap / collapse interference: It is very annoying to have this on the same side as the lever to collapse the stroller. It gets into the way so much, that I must tighten and wind the carry strap up, such that it is pretty useless as a carry strap. Add to this all that the collapse clip is on the same side, and you've got a crowded bit-of-a-mess over there. I would suggest putting the collapse foot pedal on the other side.- harness: The shoulder straps are a little short for winter-time. (I.E., times when my kid is in a big jacket.) My 32 lb son has should straps that are maxed out.- leg recline: I wish this had a flip out piece to be a bit longer for toddlers. As it is, my half of my son's leg hangs off, which is uncomfortable, so we don't really use this feature.- canopy: great sun coverage, but I wish there were a flap so that I didn't need a rain cover, but could just flip it out to keep water from draining on my son's knees.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 26, 2013", "summary": "Should have upgraded sooner"}

They are also soft on my baby's skin and keep him dry. He's never had a rash with these, and let's face it, they're super cute. For these reasons, I give the diaper 3 stars; I just wish I would be able to use them longer.The size 1 says it fits from 6-18 lbs, so after testing the absorbancy, I purchased 24 of them. This was a high up-front cost (almost 500 bucks}, but I planned to use them until he was around 9 months old or close to 18lbs. When we brought our baby home, he weighed 7 lbs. He was getting a rash from his disposable hospital diapers, so I attempted to put him in a Thirsties duo diaper. However, it was way too large for his 7lb body and left spaces for things to escape, even on the smallest setting. It also pulled at his umbilical cord stump and made it bleed, so we had to wait for his cord to fall out at 3 weeks of age to begin using these diapers. They were great at first, but he is now 12lbs and, although we have them on the largest setting, they are too small for him. When he moves around, the velcro just comes undone and- if the diaper doesn't come completely undone and fall off- he ends up leaking out of one or both sides. He is only 10 weeks old, so my $500 diaper stash was only good for 7 weeks.My son is in the 50th percentile for both height and weight for his age- completely average- so there is no reason why this diaper should no longer fit him at only 12 lbs. I would be understanding if he were around 15 or 16 lbs when it began to stop fitting, but it's absolutely ridiculous for these to stop fitting at only 12 lbs when Thirsties claims they last up to 18.I'm now stuck purchasing an entire new stash of diapers, and I won't be including any Thirsties diapers or products in my stash.

Bed is solid wood, with none toxic finish. The color is white, not off white as represented in the picture. The drawers do hold extra sheets and blankets and are easy to open. Only part of the bed that is not solid wood is the bottom of the drawers. They also could be a bit more specious if they went all the way to the end of bed/ other side of bed.

My toddler used this bed since 20 months and transitioned from crib to bed with an amazing ease. I have not sat on the bed but I do lean on it when I kiss my toddler good night or read her books and have not had an issue with the bottom falling out. This bed definitely holds more then 50lb.It would be 5 stars if not for the poor directions to put this bed together. Putting this bed together takes a lot of patients, as each piece needs to be connected with very poor instructions. When other reviewers said the parts did not match up make sure you push all the railings/slots as far as possible and tighten all screws - once I tightened everything all fit well together. Ultimately I did have my husband finish putting it together and he agreed with me on the lack of clear instructions.Other then that - we love it! This bed is made for standard size crib mattress. My toddler loves having the freedom of getting in and out of bed as needed.

I cannot imagine sitting around an audio only monitor and wondering what that sound was I just heard, or if my baby is okay, or if I should go up and check and risk waking her by going into the room. The picture on this monitor is so clear you can actually see your child's chest rise and fall and know that they're doing okay; that's a huge piece of security for us. We were AMAZED at how you can see perfectly in total darkness with this camera. The only complaints we have are that 1) the a/c adapter has suddenly started giving us fits. If you touch the a/c jack in the slightest way or try to move the monitor, the picture and sound blinks off and you have to jiggle and reposition it to get the picture back. This doesn't happen on battery power alone. But it's HIGHLY annoying to deal with this problem every night. Second, it interferes with our land-line phone in that the monitor gets fuzzy and buzzes when the phone is dialed or used too nearby. We have an AT&T 6.0 something or other -- a newer phone -- and still it bothers the monitor. Sometimes our wireless internet will bother it as well, but not too often. Other than those things, I consider this to be one of the most essential and best pieces of baby gear we own.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 12, 2009", "summary": "Problem with A/C adapter but otherwise great monitor"}

I think he would've preferred a more swaddle-like feel that you can get from a wrap carrier.-No hood like the Ergobaby which would be very helpful for napping or shading baby.He's now 10 months old and we've found that we use the carrier a lot more now that he's older. It's more manageable to put him in it when I don't need to support his head at the same time.If I could do it again, I would purchase a moby wrap or a wrap-like carrier in addition to this one.

I read so many reviews and decided to try the FuzziBunz and this cover. I loved the FuzziBunz already, but wanted to give a cover a shot. The first time I used it on my 3 week old DD, it leaked. I thought maybe I left it on too long. 2nd time, it leaked. Maybe it wasn't tight enough. 3rd time...you guessed it, it leaked. By this point I was getting slightly annoyed and couldn't understand why so many people gave such good reviews. It eventually became my backup diaper that I never actually used. Until one day, I needed a clean diaper and didn't want to go all the way to the laundry room and fold one. So I grabbed this cover, threw in a microfiber insert and slapped it on baby. I knew it would leak, so I checked her in an hour...still dry. An hour after that, still dry. Finally 3 hrs later, I changed her, because I didn't want her sitting in her own pee that long and her clothes were still dry. So I put this cover back into regular circulation and as each time I used it went by I liked it more and more. Fast forward to last night, when my hubby put the baby to bed. I use my FuzziBunz with a thick hemp insert and a microfiber for bed because she is in the diaper for over 12 hrs. Before, I wouldn't have dared try this lowly cover overnight. He put this cover on her not thinking and put her down. This morning, I changed her and was absolutely SHOCKED to see that she was in this cover ALL NIGHT LONG and she had a messy poop to boot. NO LEAKS!!! I finally am happy to write a review on this cover.I think the reason I had such a bad initial take with the cover is because my LO is so skinny and at 10 lbs, she was still way too small for this cover. But now she is 6 months old and 15 lbs, this fits her awesome and I just ordered the next size for her. I am so happy I gave this diaper a second shot and didn't condemn it to a life in the dust of our unused baby products.

They may not suit everyone's taste, however.My only gripe is that the largest size (12 month+) has a very large bulb at the end.  I guess the best reference I can think of is that it was quite a bit larger than those round Gerber binkies.  I tried the largest size when my baby was 18 months and she rejected it immediately.

I LOVE this stroller!  I've tried so many doubles that I've lost track, and I've hated them all.  They're too long, too wide, too hard to steer, etc.  Not this one!The Chicco Together looks stylish and cool.  I have the cubes pattern, and I really like it.  The stroller frame seems to be sturdy and stable, and there aren't a lot of pieces on the stroller that will break.  The stroller is tall, which makes it easy to get into the basket underneath.  The adjustable handle is great.  I put it on the middle setting and my husband puts it on the tallest setting and we're both comfortable pushing the stroller (I'm 5'5\", he's 6'3\").  We can both push the stroller without kicking the wheels.  The wheels on the stroller have a little bit of cush to them - they're not completely hard, which makes for a nice ride for the kids.  It is very easy to push, and the steering is phenomenal.  The seats are on the smaller side, 14\" wide, which I prefer.  My 45 lb 4 year old would fit in them, but they're not huge.  The weight recommendation is 40 lbs per seat, and a 40 lb child would easily fit in the seats.  I like a smaller seating area for the kids.  In some of the other strollers, my kids seemed to slop around in the huge seats.  They are 6 months (23 lbs) and 2 1/2 years (28 lbs) and they are very comfortable in the seats.  I like the five point harnesses, and the buckles seem to be good and sturdy.  The front seat has the option of two cupholders or a bar.  I opted to put the bar on, and was pleased to see that the bar is covered in fabric, rather than foamy material.  The baby can chew on the bar (and she does!) without me being afraid she's going to bite a piece of foam off.  The stroller is easy to fold and unfold, and I really like that when you fold the stroller, it stays folded.  You don't have to flip a switch or a lever to make it stay.  The stroller is not as long as lot of the doubles, which I love.  I hate to feel like I'm pushing a train, and this stroller is definitely not a train.  I believe it is 47 inches from the bar on the front to the handle.  It is compact, while still having enough space for kids and bags.  The fabric is well stitched and feels like it will hold up really well.Overall, I am absolutely loving this stroller.  Easy to push, easy to steer, sylish, comfortable, and great!

I had the Firstyears bottle warmer model before this auto one. Measuring the water with a little vial each time was a pain in the rear! Having the water tank on this model is very convenient. Some reviewers said the beep alert was loud - they must have bionic hearing! The beep alert is just 8 chirps, and if I'm not in the room, I can't hear it at all. It's the same type of chirp/beep as an old 80's style digital watch. I really like the exact settings - ounces, starting temp (room, fridge or frozen), bottle type (standard, wide like my Medela bottles, disposable, and jar food) and type of milk or food; formula, breastmilk or jar food. When I had the other warmer I was always concerned with how much heat was used as breastmilk needs to be warmed slowly to preserve the antibodies. While it can take 5-6 minutes for a 5 oz bottle to warm up it's by steam so bottles aren't submerged in hot water and no worries of overheating. In standby mode the center button is solid and the selection buttons flash. 3 clicks of the on button are needed from this stage to start the heating - directions weren't clear on this. I don't touch any buttons at the conclusion of a cycle btw - so 3 clicks and it's on if the settings are the same. It comes with a basket to lower jar food and a top ring over the chamber to keep the steam in and bottle centered - only wish it could be tightened as sometimes it pops off when removing my wide bottles. Overall, I am very happy with this warmer! It's compact, holds enough water for 2 days of bottle warmings, and is quite reliable. Only improvements could be a longer cord and maybe a count down screen so you know exactly how long the wait is; I'd pay more for that feature. This warmer will definitely grow with us when solid foods are introduced with the jar setting! DO give this one a try if you need a compact warmer with specialized settings that won't break the bank! ;-)", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 2, 2012", "summary": "Fantastic bottle warmer, no more guess work at 3 am!"}

Not sure how others would work. I tried a fat Avent and it didn't work as well. I think the Playtex work nicely because they are angled.

It's colorful and happy, and it has lots of fun stuff to play with. As a jumper, I think it's great. I like the three height settings (Rainforest has this, too), and it is easy for my kid to bounce. The toys are fun, though I think there may be a bit too much going on here. Still, I do like the look of everything.Unfortunately, that's about all that impressed me, and here's why. First off, the plastic parts feel cheaper and more flimsy than the same (or similar) parts in the Rainforest jumperoo. I was really surprised by the difference in seat quality, especially; the Step N Play's plastic seat is much thinner than my other one and feels less durable. Moreover, my seat cover doesn't fully button to the plastic seat. The buttonholes are too loose, so the seat cover, no matter how I maneuver it, becomes detached at parts. I got around that by attaching the seat to as many buttons as I could and then quickly snapping the seat into the base so the material was locked into place, but still. The craftsmanship could be better.Second, it was actually difficult for me to put this jumperoo together. I don't know why I had such a tough time snapping the legs into place, but they kept getting stuck, not wanting to move down into the shortest position. That was never a problem for me with the Rainforest jumperoo. Eventually I got everything where it needed to be, but, again, I couldn't help feeling like the craftsmanship wasn't as good as it could have been.Third, as far as what makes this product different from other jumperoos--namely, its capacity to become a walker--I'm just not sold. I wasn't sure how this feature worked at first, but after testing it out a bit, I realized that the bars (hidden by the large green toys on either side of the jumperoo) extend--and once you extend them, your baby can take a few steps forward and a few steps backward. I suppose this is a cool feature in theory, but, honestly, how fun or interesting is it to take a few steps straight forward or straight back? Moreover, this unimpressive feature adds a lot of bulk to an already HUGE piece of baby gear--not to mention a higher price tag.I realize that every kid is different. (Mine certainly are.) And though I'm still not impressed with the quality, size, or price of this jumperoo, if your kid could benefit from practicing some basic and limited steps, maybe you will find this jumperoo to be more useful and impressive than we have. For our needs, though, this seat missed the mark, and I would still recommend theFisher-Price Rainforest Jumperooover the Step N Play.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2014", "summary": "Lots to play with, but the added walker feature isn't worth the price."}

You can't pump directly into them.4.  It is very difficult to warm milk because of the thick plastic and rubber insert at the bottom.  It takes 3-4x the time it takes for milk to heat up in other bottles.5.  When attempting to heat the bottles, I noticed the water would turn cloudy.  The milk would leak out of the bottle, and I am pretty sure water was being soaked up into the bottle.  This occurred even if the bottle was properly assembled.6.  The holes at the bottom of the bottle is a perfect place for bacteria, mold spores, etc. to enter the bottle when placed on different surfaces (counters, refrigerator shelves, tables, etc).  I am uncomfortable leaving this bottle in the fridge for more than a day because of this, which renders this bottle useless to me.7.  HASSLE!!!!Pros:1. They look nice.2.

The curved edges of the ring really does its job of preventing the food from spilling!

So this type of feeding dish is really a must for me to keep her from making a lot of mess!One of my favorite things about this dish is its shape. A lot of feeding bowls and dishes are thick and bulky to put in a diaper bag. But this one is not so I really like taking this with me anywhere I go with my baby. The container is non-spill too so even if I put this in my bag sideways with one side filled with baby food (puree/powder), it won't leak.However, there are few things I hope they would add to this container to make it more ideal for traveling.  First, I hope they would put a non-spill divider between the two compartments so even if both sides are filled with pureed baby food or powdered cereal, it won't mix together however you place it inside a diaper bag. Lastly, though its not really of a big deal, it would be nice to include a spoon attached inside our outside the dish just like the other brands' feeding set!Overall, I'm always satisfied and impressed with OXO products so this is still one of the best dishes for babies in the market!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2014", "summary": "Top notch quality and features but not ideal for traveling"}

I didn't get it on Amazon - some poor fool gave it away and it fell into my eager little paws.

Time is precious as a mother - I don't want to spend 20 minutes JUST filling the baby's tub. I also love that the water stays warm and my baby's lower body stays submerged. Getting him to sleep soundly on his back is enough of a nightmare, don't make me bathe him that way too. Bathtime takes place in his bedroom, mere steps away from his changing table. The whole experience is quiet, calm, and relaxing for both of us.A lot of people complain that this tub is useless for a full-body scrubdown, but um... are you rolling your infant through the mud? They don't get THAT dirty. Give baby a nice little sponge bath in the nether regions before bathtime, then let them soak in the tub.Others mock the Tummy Tub, pointing out the similarity to its ugly cousin - a regular old bucket. Errr.... bathing your child in a bucket from Lowe's is a really terrible way to save money. The Tummy Tub is only manufactured for one purpose - so you won't find any sharp edges or seams that could scratch your baby.---> One thing I can suggest is that you don't need to fill the tub all the way to the fill line. My son is only 3 months old, so he's squirmy and his head is constantly bobbing around. It makes it easier to maneuver if I stop filling half an inch before the line - that way the water isn't so high when he's in there. I feel a little less freaked out and bathtime lasts a little longer, which leaves both of us far more content with the experience.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2013", "summary": "Love this tub"}

This sun shade has four plastic corners that are made of hard plastic. That means that in an accident, these corners could harm occupants when this shade becomes a projectile in the car.The hard plastic corners contain a blue &#34;push here to secure&#34; button that is supposed to help keep the shade on the window by better securing the suction cups.  Unfortunately, they don't work very well, and the shade still falls off the window, especially if they get very hot or very cold (which is hard to prevent unless you live in a very temperate climate!).The size of this shade is good for standard car windows, but it is a bit large for compact cars' windows.  Trying to make it smaller by placing the suction cups closer together doesn't work because then the gaps cause it to be difficult to see through the shade (a safety issue).This shade has FAR less hard plastic than those &#34;roller shades&#34; that are made for car windows, and thus is probably not AS dangerous, but hard plastic is NOT good to have a in a car, especially near the delicate heads of children. Instead of choosing a shade with hard plastic, choose one that is made of soft materials only. Soft fabric and vinyl are fine, but hard plastic (or metal) is not. Think-- if you wouldn't be okay with the item hitting your child's head, you don't want it in your car!", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2014", "summary": "Hard plastic corners, doesn't stay on window"}

(Note: we did purchase this through Amazon, but my review does not have an Amazon Verified Purchase because we ordered it under my husband's account.) I wanted to get one that had a \"shower cap\" style that fit snugly over the top of the car seat instead of one that fit underneath the straps, since I heard types that fit the latter style could interfere with the safety of the straps.The good: It fits great on the Keyfit 30, almost as if it was designed for this particular car seat. I also think it's a very warm and toasty cover, and had no concerns that it was keeping him warm enough regardless of the outside temperature. I would actually recommend unzipping the front panel for car rides with the heat on, since I would often find him sweaty after having kept it closed while in the car.The bad: The problem with the \"shower cap\" style is that, when installed, the height of the face hole is fixed. This means that if your baby is taller/older, his or her face will be offset towards the top of the hole, which will make it hard to get the baby in and out of the car seat. When we first started using it, our baby seemed like he was starting to get a little tall for the face hole, since he was about 4 1/2 months old. After using it for about two months, I finally had to take it off and stop using it because it was very difficult to not to catch his head on the fabric above the face hole when putting him in or taking him out, which usually resulted in crying. Our baby is on the smaller side for height and especially weight, so I would guess most babies would be too big for this by about 6 months of age. We now use a blanket, which is much less convenient, so I am considering trying our nephew's hand me down JJ Cole for the rest of the winter.In summary, I can highly recommend this car seat cover for babies born in late fall or winter, especially for those with the Chicco Keyfit 30. If, however, your baby will be older than 6 months by the time you expect to stop using the cover, I would recommend going with a different cover, or expecting you will have to stop using it by then.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2013", "summary": "Great warm cover for Chicco Keyfit 30, but works best for smaller babies"}

The flap with velcro was good for walking outside in the snow, and the zippers were nice for letting the baby breath once in the warm car.I think you are supposed to be able to easily get your baby in and out of the seat without removing this cover, but we did not find that to be the case.

I just bleach it off every now and again. Easy! I do wonder if the hole in the middle is a little small -- maybe forces her to sit with her legs too close together to &#34;go&#34;?? It's hard to tell though.  The &#34;carry bag&#34; it comes with shouldn't even be advertised as such -- it's just a regular ziplock bag.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2013", "summary": "Works well for us!"}

Part of the problem is that the entryway is extra wide--over 50 inches--and we had trouble finding gates wide enough just to fit.  After several frustrating attempts at finding a decent gate (including resultant trips back to the baby store for refunds/exchanges), we finally bought this foot-pedal operated gate (with 2 extensions) and it works awesome.  It's absolutely the nicest gate we have ever bought.  Although our son (18 months, ~28 pounds) has an idea of -how- it works, the foot pedal requires far too much pressure for him to get it to open.  This gate should be usable until he's at least 35, if not 40 pounds.  In addition, since it's made of metal bars and not some sort of crisscross pattern, my child cannot stick his toes in it and try to climb over--all he can do is step up on the bottom metal bar, which is only about 3 inches off the ground.As an added bonus, the gate is tall enough to keep kids out but not so tall that my cat can't jump over it easily.Only caveats I can think of:+ You have to tighten the tension screws periodically.+ The gate opening is a few inches narrower than would be ideal, so if you're \"wide\" like me you have to get used to kind of side-stepping through it.+ By default, the gate makes an audible \"click\" when it closes, which can wake a light-sleeping child; but with a little practice, you can get it to close soundlessly.+ The wrench provided for tightening is plastic, and once the tension screws get tight the wrench tends to slip off them a little too easily.All in all I would definitely recommend this gate to anyone.

I am a busy working mom, and had arrangements with my boss for time at work to do this when I returned back after only a 5 week leave. We got this pump on walmart.com for the store pickup feature, which was the cheapest I could find it at the time. I loved the carry case so I could inconspiculously take it to work without all of my nosy male coworkers bugging me about it. Hah.Well, to make a long story short, I hardly produced any breast milk at all. After the first 2 weeks of giving my son every drop of breast milk I produced, we realized my body was not keeping up with his hungry tummy, so we started using this pump and mixing what I could get in with his formula. We ended up using the pump for approximately 2 weeks, until my son was a month old, so as far as longevity goes, I can't tell you that this pump outlasts all of the others, but the suction was great on it, the suction cups were comfortable, it was pretty easy to clean and gave us no problems at all. Here's my one piece of advise if you are looking at this pump: Just get the single pump. This one comes with an attachment with a handle where you can use one hand to pump both breasts at the same time. Several reasons why I ended up never using that arm:- Although it was adjustable, it was made for people whose breasts were very close together. There was absolutely no way for me to use it because of how tiny you had to have been for the width to be correct for you. (I am a small frame, 36C. Very average thin build and it wouldn't work for me!)- Even if it had worked for me, the suction cups, although comfortable, don't \"stick\" well (not on me anyhow) and I needed to hold them with my hand supporting the bottom of my breast and the suction cup so that I didn't leak all down my front. Therefore, this would make the handle pointless. I was still having to use two hands.- After tying up both of my hands, I then resorted to just using one of the suction cups at a time, as if it were a single pump. I really wanted a free hand for the tv remote while I was waiting, to pacify my son sitting in his swing next to me, or to pet my cat who would nudge me the whole time I was sitting still pumping. Hah.Like I said, great pump, but I really recommend the single pump which does cost less. I plan on keeping this for child number 2 in a few years. Maybe I can comment on longevity then.** See my review on the bottle gift set that matches this pump. Everything is interchangeable, so you can pump directly into the bottles, and it comes with additional storage lids for the containers.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 4, 2011", "summary": "Great pump, should have just purchased the single pump tho!"}

The adapter for the double stroller sits just as high but is not as unstable because of the wider base (although when using it for only one baby you are supposed to slide the car seat to the center of the double stroller to maintain even weight distribution).On the up side, even when leaving the adapter attached, the stroller is easy to fold and doesn't take up much more space than just the stroller itself.

I keep a normal buckle front carrier in the car just for that purpose.

Another difference between this wrap and it's less expensive counterparts is the pocket placed over wear the baby sits. The pocket is fine for storing loose cash but anything other than that may affect the comfort of your baby in my opinion.

The whole system is interchangeable which is nice.- super easy to put together- holds a good amount of liquidCONS:- the bottom part of the straw sometimes comes loose out of the upper part of the straw when you have anything thicker than regular liquid in the cup (like a smoothie). Kind of a pain.- the cup leaks from the straw from time to time - but then again, my kid likes to shake the cup upside down...Overall, LOVE these cups! They're so adorable. I'd definitely recommend them.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2014", "summary": "Awesome cups!"}

We also have been out to eat twice and just kept her in there. It keeps her very quiet and peaceful and she sleeps great in it. My husband actually fell asleep the other night in our rocker with her in it for 5 hours.I watched a video online of the way to wear it for a newborn and then I went to a local baby shop and they showed me a different way, which i much prefer. Basically, instead of folding all of the fabric in half, you keep it open. It's hard to explain but once you have the Moby it might make sense. I am not sure how good this is for when they get older but it's awesome for newborns.Also, my friends who had their baby in the summertime said it was just too hot to wear the Moby around when it's hot outside. ith our January baby its prefect, it keeps her nice and warm.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2013", "summary": "My newborn LOVES the Moby and so do we!

Each page is heavy duty clear plastic with a small black and white striped border. The openings for the pictures are at the spine so there is really no way a baby or toddler could get to them.

My 4 month old son loves it! The pages are very clear (easy to see through) and easy to clean. He loves looking at people in person, and this album mesmerizes him. Also, he is just starting to get into the everything-in-the-mouth stage, and I have no worries about him chewing away on this book.Of all the things I have gotten for my son, this book is one of the best buys I've made!UPDATE: 5 months later and my son still loves this album. He has chewed it, bent it, twisted it, thrown it about, and tried to rip it apart, and has not damaged it yet. The white cover is now more yellow, but I don't really care about that.

Yes, some of their products can be quite pricey, but with the range there is always something new moms will love.  Starting out with theBoppy Newborn Loungerand adding the Boppy Tummy time would be a perfect shower gift.  Pediatricians do recommend thirty minutes of tummy time a day and using this Boppy Tummy Time cushion is an excellent way to achieve it.Your pediatrician is likely to discuss the importance of tummy time and will let you know when to start. When I reviewed theBoppy Garden Patch Play GymI had a few suggestions which I'll adapt to the Boppy Tummy Time:* Take off your baby's socks so he or she will be able to push and reach for the toys on the directly in front of them.  Babies start to reach for objects beginning at two months.* Start slowly and put your baby on the Tummy Time for only a few minutes at a time, gradually increasing the time. If you start early enough it will seem like a natural position.* Don't put the baby down on with a full tummy as it can be very uncomfortable.* Rotate toys to prevent baby boredom. There are a couple of attached toys, but putting favorites in front can help make tummy time more fun.* Every baby is different so watch carefully to see what is liked and not liked about tummy time and work with your baby so the time can be a happy one.The only drawback is that you can't throw this in the washer and can only spot clean it.  The Boppy Garden Play Gym had a similar tummy time pillow included, but purchasing the one separately is a plus if you don't want or need the gym.  It's quite easy to take with you and would definitely be a welcome, affordable gift for any new mom.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2013", "summary": "This Boppy Tummy Time Pillow is an excellent way to achieve baby's 30-minute tummy time each day ..."}

It was not easy finding a bed rail that I thought was safe enough or easy enough to use for that size mattress. The way that this bed rail was designed, it is easy to install onto any size mattress.My husband and I co sleep with our 3 month old and while my husband and I enjoy sleeping under the covers, my baby does not because he still has to be swaddled to sleep well at night. We got the bed rail so that he could sleep on the edge of the bed instead of the middle and not worry about him rolling off the bed (and he does roll, both ways, and can roll all the way over from back to tummy and onto his back again).First of all, it was delivered very quickly. I have Amazon Mom and selected free 2 day shipping on this item. It was delivered the day after I placed the order!The product itself was very simple to put together. I put it together myself without my husband within 5 minutes. My husband installed it onto our bed within 5 minutes as well.This seems to be a very sturdy rail. I love the mesh, because I don't have to worry about him burying his face into it if he does roll over.  It's very tall as far as keeping a kid from rolling off of the mattress, I imagine I will have lots of trouble with this when my son learns to stand, but then again if he is in a twin or full size bed the mattress may be thin enough to make the rail height more significant. It is very long rail, and works great on our king size mattress, so I know as far as length goes it will work fine with whatever bed we transition the little one to.The only downside to this is the length of the rail (and my arm span) makes it difficult to unlock and fold down. My arm span is just long enough to reach both locking mechanisms, so my hand dexterity is compromised when I attempt to do anything at that range. The length is not a problem for my husband by himself, but I most certain will require assistance if I ever needed to put the rail down.I highly recommend this rail, just for the ease of assembly, installation, and of course the shipping speed was excellent.Update: About a week after I wrote this review my son started fussing while swaddled at night, so he started sleeping free and loose. As a result, he can now roll around in bed and has rolled right into the bed rail. I have had to move him away from the bed rail, and have found him in a variety of positions. He has had his face pressed against it, he has been on his back and right against it, he has been on his stomach and right against it, and he has been on his side with his back to the mesh. I'm pleased that the bed rail has not budged at all. My son easily weighs around 16 lbs at this point, and I have no concerns about whether or not the bed rail will hold his weight and keep him from falling. I'm extremely pleased with this product.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 30, 2011", "summary": "Updated: Seems sturdy, fits a king size mattress"}

It is HUGE and also has a pocket on it to store the diapers and wipes so all you need to carry around is the folded changing pad.  It is one of the best changing pads I've seen.- I Love the backpack feature- It has a nice sturdy bottom with feet to keep the bag upright and cleanCons:- the fabric is a little thin, and I can see it wearing thin after prolonged use.  However, overall the bag is pretty good quality.-the pockets in the main compartment are HUGE and really nice.  The problem is that if they are filled, there is very little room to put anything in the middle of the bag.  Or, if there is anything in the middle, it is very hard to get to the bottom of the bag because the large filled pockets literally take up the entire space of the bag.-The bag is large, but not quite big enough for my needs.  I have two boys under two, and I need to carry a lot of stuff. The bag is really, really tight and this bag would be perfect if it was a little bigger.-the bottle pockets on the side are nice, but are a little deep and it can be a challenge to get a bottle or sippy cup out if they are short.- the fabric on the inside of the bag is loose and not connected to the bag, so it bunches up a little bit.  However, since it is only connected at the top, the fabric can be turned inside out to get any crumbs out.Overall, this is a gorgeous bag with the awesome ability to become a backpack.  It is a lot cheaper than the other backpack diaper bags out there, and it is good quality as well.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 9, 2012", "summary": "I LOVE this bag"}

This drying rack from Avent is pretty limited in how you can use it.  It will hold just 8 bottles and knocking over pieces, like the nipples is highly likely with this rack. I do however like how easy it is to drain water from the bottom tray.  For what this drying rack costs, I would suggest going with the Boon grass or lawn drying rack. It does an excellent job of holding a days worth of bottles or sippy cups and pacifiers and things stay put and don't fall off of it.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014", "summary": "It will get the job done but there are better options"}

Unfortunately, this system doesn't quite work out for the ends of the spectrum--toddler and newborn.  For our newborn (3 weeks) the prefolds are very thick, and end up being exceptionally bulky. For the toddler, trifolding the prefold and simply placing it in the cover just doesn't cut it.  He is so active that it ends up bunching and slipping inside, resulting in poo all over the cover, and half the point of our decision to use prefolds and covers is that you don't have to use a new cover with every change.  They are too narrow to use with a snappi or pin for this age.That said, however, I am very optimistic about using the system when our littlest is a bit bigger.  We already use the covers with small, folded and snappied prefolds, though he is only about 8.5 lbs, they fit just fine.  The prefolds themselves are very soft and absorbent, and the covers are well made.  Definitely a great price, and a perfect introduction to cloth for someone looking to start with a baby that is a few months or older.ETA: I've started using the covers again for our toddler, this time with a larger (toddler sized) prefold, and they work great.

I don't know if mine were returned and then regiven to me, but the sides of the plastic packaging holding the cups were closed with some type of tape which was impossible to rip.Now on to the cups.Both the baby and I liked the design of the cup. The handles make it very easy for him to hold and of course throw across the room!The instructions indicate you are to wash the cup in warm soapy water before use (of course) and to separate the silicone spout from the cup. This was really hard to do. I ended up using a dinner knife to pry the side up and then pulling it out. It is also hard to put it back in.Out of the four cups, two of the cups initially were almost impossible for the baby to suck his water or juice through the little slits. After manipulating the silicone and opening them up I didn't need to resort to poking a larger slit with a knife or something. So be warned if your child's face is turning red and he is getting frustrated, he may not be able to get much liquid through the top of the cup. Take the silicone piece out and roll it hard between your hands/fingers to try and open the slit up. If that doesn't work, perhaps a sharp implement will help!Some of the positives include the plastic being BPA free, the secure click-able lock which prevents spills and the handles. The cons as I see them aside from getting them out of the package includes the difficulty in getting the silicone spout in and out of the holder.

Once again, this might be OK for some, but for me, it is annoying, at best.The sound quality is OK... it's not as good as the Avent unit we have, the sound is sometimes muffled, and I can't make out my wife's voice very clearly when she's talking to baby.  With the Avent it is crystal clear.  Then again, the Avent cost twice as much.The thermometer appears to be accurate and reliable.  I also found the nightlight to be nice, although we have not used it.  It's still a nice feature to include.  On that same note, I don't like the bright green LED on the front of the base unit; when it is on, it is BRIGHT.

We put it together wrong twice and kept having to take it apart and click it back together because the instruction manual wasn't clear on which direction some of the bars were supposed to go. My partner is usually pretty good at putting these things together, but there were a couple of curse words uttered during the installation process. Again, it's not that it was hard to put together, but that the instruction manual was so wildly unclear.I also don't care for the toy bar. The two little bears hanging from a Velcro square don't seem very entertaining, and it's not really built to work with other types of mobile. The toy bar is so flimsy that it wants to pop off all the time, which makes it pretty much useless.That said, this is a beautiful, stable, and attractively designed swing. It looks lovely in my nursery, is soft and appealing, and has a wide base that seems much more secure than the two used swings I have from friends. I love that it has a timer setting for the rocking and even has a vibration option. It can be plugged in to save batteries for the rocking, music, and white noise, but you'll need to use a D battery for the vibration. I don't usually keep D batteries around, so I would've preferred using more than one AA, but that's a pretty small complaint.On my carpet, the rocking takes about 10 to 15 seconds to get fully up to speed, which is good because I don't want to startle my newborn. Even though I have carpeting and the manual says that it's best on a hard floor, I haven't noticed any issue with the functionality of the rocking setting.Overall, this is a beautifully designed and attractive swing. It's obviously stable, secure and safe, with the base that feels like it would be impossible to tip even if your baby is flailing or squirmy. The design is so nice that it doesn't feel like your home is being taken over by awful and gaudy baby stuff, and it's so soft and snugly that it's a very appealing little napping spot.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2013", "summary": "Great swing for newborns but toy bar is useless"}

First thing first, this bottle warmer is available at Walmart for $15. I saw the price on Amazon going from $15-$35. So just beware and don't get rips off.We have been using this warmer to warm up frozen breastmilk for 9 months and had no issue at all. Other than the deposits in the heat plate even though we been using distilled water the entire time.We know this warmer wasn't designed for frozen breastmilk but formila in room tempreture. However, other warmer works better for breastmilk are just too expensive. Also due to the bottle storage we use (no bags), we wanted to give this bottle a try. In order to get it to work, we have to experiment and find out the best amount of water measurement to pour into the steamer.The milk bottle we use are the medela plastic one (ok with high heat), we stay away from glass bottle because they get over heated easy and very hard to control the tempreture. Now every bottle of breastmilk we have has different volume of milk but in avg we have about 120ml to 150ml, I take out the bottle from the freezer, turn the cap half open (enough for it to breath but not losen). Then I fill up the measuring tube full (i don't even need those number line these days, they are useless for my purpose), I pour all water in there, set the bottle in the steamer, and I cover it with a coffee mug that fit perfectly (not tight), turn the switch and after 3-4 mins, it will auto turn off, usually there'll be a small cube of frozen milk floating in the bottle, that's why I leave it alone covered for another 2 mins before I take it out and feed the baby. If I'm heating up 150ml- 200ml, I just steam it again with 1/5 to 1/4 water filled in the tube. Everything comes out perfect.This thing is awesome and save us a lot of money.

I CAN see if baby's head is in the proper position and see if baby is smiling or frowning, making this semi-functional when mirror is placed right.  The biggest problem is that when someone sits in the back seat next to baby, they may touch the hand or foot of the frog as they are buckling themselves in.  If they do, then it moves the mirror and the quest to get the mirror placed correctly starts all over again.

I look forward to seeing how my baby likes it - in two months. While it says 4m to 6m, both the world health organization and american academy of pediatrics recommend 6 months minimum before solids - before then baby's gut is immature and they can become sick much more easily because of solid food. Breastmilk is still the best food, and failing that, formula. On this subject, the little advice booklet that comes with this thing has babies fully weaned by 9-12 months! That's too early! Again, WHO and AAP both recommend breast feeding for longer - AAP 12 months AT LEAST, WHO at least 2 years. Failing that, they should still be on formula at 12 months.

Because his digestive system was still immature, he was extremely difficult to burp, which caused MAJOR gas issues. After going through 2 bottles of Mylicon in the first 2 weeks after he was born, I decided to give these bottles a try. Wow! I saw a difference after the first feeding. I went to burp my son, expecting to spend my usual 15-20 minutes trying to get him to burp, and imagine my surprise after two minutes this HUGE burp came out of this tiny baby! And an hour later, he was happy as a clam, where in the past, he would have his legs pulled up to his chest, in pain from gas.I don't understand what the problem is that people have with cleaning the bottles. So they come with two extra parts...big deal. I hand-wash my bottles, and sterilize them in the dishwasher about once a week, and after the first few washes, the extra parts were a non-issue. I also can't figure out how people can't seem to get the beige vent or the tube clean. Unless you let your bottles sit for days until the forumla gets caked on, a simple soaking in hot water and dish detergent before using the special brush should be all that is needed to keep the vent and the tube clean. If that doesn't work, then you can always boil the pieces for about a minute to sterilize them, without the pieces becoming distorted. I also shake the vents and tubes out after washing to dislodge any water that might be remaining inside the holes. Also, if necessary, I have seen in the Babies R Us store that they sell a 2-pack of vents, as well as a 2-pack of tubes in case the need for new ones arises.My only complaint is that the bottles do leak if they fall on their side for a period of time, so that can be a little tricky when traveling in the diaper bag. I solved that problem by pre-measuring water and putting it into one of my Medela breast pump bottles (which come with lids). Then, while I'm out, I just add formula to the breast pump bottle and shake, then I pour the formula into the empty Dr. Brown's bottle.

I didn't go through Amazon since I know the white caps set will come instead of blue caps, so I went to Drugstore.com instead.  They had the blue caps picture shown, but then the title says \"One Step\".  I ordered 2 sets cause I didn't know what will actually show up, because \"One Step\"-labelled boxes have only 1 pump adaptor.  But other types boxes have 2 adaptors.  I called Drugstore.com before I ordered but they didn't know either.Well, guess what, the red/yellow box with white caps showed up, with 2 adaptors.  I promptly tested ALL caps, 1/2 of them leaked.  A nerd in nature, I carefully inspected them & compared to my blue caps from a gift set.  So this is the reason why the new white caps leak:1. Old blue caps have 3 parts: liner ring (insert liner into it), sealer cap ring, sealer pad.  The \"sealer pad\" is soft & rubbery, which you insert into the sealer cap ring.  The sealer pad has a flat, wide lip that'll press against the entire liner rim.  When twisted close, because the pad is so soft, it's easy to get a tight seal.  I twisted the blue \"soft sealer pad + sealer cap ring\" combo onto all leaking white liner rings, none leaked.  So the sealer cap structure is key.2. New white caps fused the \"sealer pad\" & the \"seal cap ring\" together into one.  Now you have basically a hard plastic cap with a rim protruding along the inner base.  When you twist the cap & the liner ring together by themselves, you can see that thin rim comes through into the liner ring.  So that means the liner must be held precisely in between the tiny gap between the rim & the cap itself.  Now that takes some work.  Also, because the whole thing now is a hard plastic piece, it's automatically harder to get a tight seal than with soft, rubbery, more press-able material.  I've had incidents where I found out that 1/4 of liner actually wasn't twisted in.  So when I did my 10-sec shaking over the sink test, water literally squirted all over the countertops.  Thank goodness it's only water, not pumped breast milk.  Also, to get the precise seal, you almost have to spend an extra minute or 2 or even longer to make sure you line up all the grooves & twist & re-twist the cap until you finally, hopefully, get the right twist, before you apprehensively turn it upside down to test, hoping, \"oh, please God, please don't leak\".  While with the blue caps, it takes 2 seconds, you don't even have to think about it.I wonder what on earth was Playtex thinking:1. When something (the blue cap system) is highly rated & works well, why mess with it?2. Especially, why messing with a storage kit for pumped BREASTMILK? The most precious thing to a mother other than her baby?3. Which mother with a newborn has that kind of time just to twist & retwist & test these bloody caps AFTER PUMPING??!! which is exhausting to begin with?  & AT WORK for God's sake??Shame on Playtex.  First comes those stupid expandable 8oz liners, now this.  They need to fire the product development head immediately.  By the way I called Playtex - they changed the packaging starting January 2012.  So it's almost 99% certain that from this point on, ANYTHING you order from Playtex baby will be in these new, ugly, red/yellow boxes with dumbed down products.  DO NOT take that chance.  I will not buy anything from them until they improve their design.  What a shame indeed.  Something that worked well for years & years & they have to ruin it.I will be returning these promptly.  Shame on Drugstore.com too for false advertising the product - sending me something that look completely different from their picture/description of the item.With all that said, however, you COULD avoid the whole leaking issue by storing them standing up in a tupperware - which I read is a good way to re-use the caps anyway for mass milk production & storage.  I tested it & I found 4-oz liners worked better - they are straight,  don't tip as easily, & they thaw faster.  So if you really like the drop in system, that might be a way to salvage it...  But still, shame on Playtex...", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2012", "summary": "Reason why white caps LEAK - comparison to blue caps"}

I had to pinch the valve at just the right places to get air to go in.  Once I found the right spots I blew the whole thing up easily.  There are four valves to fully inflate the tub.Some people complain that it is slippery, however I would never leave my infant or young child in a bathtub unassisted.

The rattle/hanging pieces are fun and encouraging for my baby to reach out and the elephant cushion is so useful for tummy time or for her to just reach out and grab its ears. The mirror was especially fun. I'd put her on her tummy and hang the mirror in front of her and look at her through it and make funny faces at her from behind her. She got such a kick out of it. And yes, from time to time when I needed downtime especially at the beginning of my baby's life I'd let her lay under there for 10 minutes and just sit next to her and send a few text messages to friends or comments on Facebook.

{"reviewerID": "A2Q2A6JKY95RTP", "asin": "B004VL2VRO", "reviewerName": "R. Garrelts", "helpful": [1, 1], "unixReviewTime": 1374105600, "reviewText": "My wife and I received the Motorola MBP36 Baby Monitor as a shower gift before our son was born and have been using it for almost four months. In that time this baby monitor has become an indispensable part of our lives and daily routine. By and large this is an excellent baby monitor though there are some shortcomings and curious design choices that hamper the device.--------------------LCD & Camera:The baby monitor consists of two major components, the LCD screen and the camera. In our nursery I wall mounted the camera using an appropriately sized screw directly into a wall stud above our child's crib and within easy access to a power outlet. The AC power cord is long, approximately 3m, and is needed to power the camera. Unlike the LCD screen the camera contains no internal battery and thus cannot be used without the AC power adapter. The camera features a built-in wall mount bracket for just such applications.The LCD screen is the other primary component and features a fantastic 3.5\" color LCD screen. To the left of the LCD are the four directional buttons that control the camera's movements. To the right of the screen are four more buttons that control (top-down) menu access; \"OK\" aka \"enter\"; display on/off toggle; and microphone. The menu access button brings up the on-screen menu and the directional buttons provide navigation with the \"OK\" button serving as the 'enter' key. On-screen commands control everything from volume adjustment to lullaby's that you can choose to play via the camera's on-board speaker. The power button is located along the top-left of the base unit.--------------------Installation:Thanks to the base unit and camera communicating via 2.4GHz wireless setup is extremely easy. The most difficult portion of our installation was finding suitable placement for the camera. Because of our nursery design we didn't have a shelf that afforded a good enough vantage of our crib and ultimately decided that wall mounting was the best option. In this configuration the AC power adapter and cord are hidden behind our child's crib so that is a bonus as well. The initial pairing of the camera and base unit is guided and extremely easy and very quick.--------------------Use:Powering on the base unit also turns the camera on and is impressively fast. I'd estimate that from a powered-off state to a completely operational state takes less than two seconds. After that you're set and ready to adjust the camera, volume, etc. as needed. Range is as impressive as Motorola claims. I was dubious about the range before using this baby monitor but I can attest that it lives up to and surpasses my expectations. In my home (single-story + basement) my entire home is completely covered. Video and audio is high quality and without any distortion. I've even used this unit on our patio, in our yard and immediate surrounding area of our home with the baby monitor in my pocket and the video feed is great. The unit does alert you when you're taking it too far out of range.The camera video feed quality is very good as well. Being first time parents we were initially very nervous about every little noise and movement from our baby and constantly monitoring him for any potential problems. That said, the quality of the video feed is enough that you can see a baby's chest rise and fall with their breathing. Audio is equally impressive and picks up on very minute noises. Funny as it might be but we can hear our little boy's burps and flatulence through the monitor. I suspect that this is in part to the proximity of the camera unit to our son and crib. I'm not sure if this unit would pick up those noises if the camera was mounted further away.--------------------What I like about this baby monitor:(+) Very easy setup and operation.(+) Unit powers on and is usable almost instantaneously.(+) Great quality video and audio to include the night vision mode.(+) Construction quality seems adequate given the price point.(+) Expandable with more cameras for folks with more than one baby. Scanning mode to automatically switch between cameras.(+) Attractive design.--------------------What I don't like about this baby monitor:(-) The power button is tiny and sits flush with the top of the unit. This may be a conscious design decision to make the unit harder to accidentally turn off for tired parents.(-) The volume controls require entering the menu to adjust. It is the very first option on the on-screen menu but it's still a paint to adjust in a dark room.(-) The microphone button (allows you to talk through the cameras speaker) is located directly below the video on/off toggle and is in a horrible place! It's very easy to inadvertently hit the microphone button in a dark room or when sleepy instead of the video button if you're just trying to check on your baby.(-) If I had been paying the bill I probably would go with a cheaper baby monitor. This is a very nice monitor but expensive.(-) The zoom function is very limited and only goes to 2x. Again not a huge issue for our application but worth noting.--------------------Technical issues:Only once, but the base unit after being on all day failed to power on (was connected to the charger). Letting the base unit sit unplugged for an hour and then trying to power on again solved the issue. Seemed like it was an overheating issue. Again only happened once but something worth mentioning.--------------------Closing:If you can stomach the price and some odd button placement then this is a very nice baby monitor. Some of the features seem like add-on gimmicks (playing lullaby's for instance) rather than practical options for a baby monitor.

My now 4 month old daughter has just outgrown her infant tub, and since she doesn't have her own bathroom yet, I wanted to get something that was easy to store.  This was our answer!  I just fill the tub of with warm water and let it lay in it, in order for it to absorb the water, while I undress her.  I lay her in it and wala, she doesn't move!!!  She can still splash her feet which is great!  After bathtime, just wring and hang on the shower rod.  How easy is that?!  Of course, since I've only used it once I haven't had any problems with mold, but I plan on washing it everyweek, so I hope that helps.  If it becomes a problem, I will update this review!Update:Well I have been using this product for about two months now and it DOES have mildew! EW!! (Reduced to 3 stars) It is not stink however, but the mildew is very obvious! I have washed it weekly and dried it after every bath but still mildew!

Welch", "helpful": [1, 1], "unixReviewTime": 1371168000, "reviewText": "I purchased this used so not sure if maybe that's why it didn't come with the temperature strip but otherwise this is a great tub. I think it's better than the First Year's version that has a two-seat setup. I prefer this one because we can lean baby back or have her sit up but not feel confined. Our girl is a bit feisty and wants to do what she wants to do so it helps her to feel like she's choosing to sit up.It's a challenge now at 7 months to get her to lean back in the tub at all. But before she was sitting on her own the reclining position with the wedge in place worked really well. There was only once or twice that she kind of arched her back and ended up \"floating\" on top of the wedge, which she didn't like and I could see being dangerous. (minus 1 star) If she hadn't been able to reach the other end with her feet she could have easily slid under the water. But that's why you can't leave them alone for a second in the water.Now that she sits up she wants to stay sitting up. We had left the wedge in and were still using the reclining side with her legs over the wedge although she sat forward. The wedge kept her from moving around too much but then she learned how to use the wedge while grabbing the opposite side of the tub to leverage herself into a bent over and/or standing position. Fun to watch her stand up but not fun to wrangle a slippery baby while she's trying to stand up (and MUST. STAND. UP.). So we removed the wedge and now she can sit in the tub with plenty of room to splash and move a bit without having anything to help her get out.And that's what's nice about the tub, it can be modified to create a variety of environments for baby's bath time. I also appreciate the hook to hang it up to dry. We have an extra shower rod in the middle of the shower so we hang it on that when we're not using the tub. You just have to go knock out the bit of water that doesn't slide all the way out so that it will dry.  So far (4 months), despite a bathroom that's a mold/mildew magnet, we haven't had any problems with the stopper getting mildewy and it holds the water - no leaks.(Although we have the sling I got the tub when baby girl was already too big to use it so can't comment on it.)Update 5/20/14:We're still using this tub and our girl is now 18 months old. She's comfortable in it and it uses less water than if we were using the entire bathtub for her. We did put the wedge back in though because without it there were times that she slipped despite being sitting down. She's fine with the wedge and will now sometimes lean back so her toes are under the water from the faucet and wait for us to pour water on her - the wedge keeps her from sliding all the way down. It's like a spa for her. We also still have no issues with leaks or mold/mildew.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 14, 2013", "summary": "Great for a variety of bathing baby stages"}

Well I did not get that with this pillow. It is way too over-stuffed and stiff to be comfortable and the cover is itchy. I prefer more than less when it comes to pillows but this one is just ridiculous how big it is. It's hard to climb out of it for frequent nightly trips to the bathroom. The first night I got a terrible pain in my neck and ended up throwing it off the bed. I tried it again last night and after struggling to find a comfy position where my neck wasn't at some weird angle, I threw it off the bed again. Also, it is too short for my long legs; I am 5'9. My lower legs and feet hang awkwardly off the end of the pillow. The back support felt nice but the pillow bulge in my belly was not comfy. I felt like my baby was getting smooshed as my belly does not exactly sit on top of the pillow bulge so maybe I am not big enough for it at 19 weeks. I will stick to my body pillow for now and pass this pillow along to my 6'4 230lbs husband to use hoping it will keep his head elevated so he will snore less. And maybe his big body can flatten it some for me so I can try it again in the future when baby is bigger.Update- I am now 32 weeks and the pillow still sucks. After it just sat in a spare bedroom for months I decided to give it another try because my belly is definitely much bigger. The belly support is a little stiff, not very giving so it doesn't cradle my belly like my softer body pillow. And the pillow is still not comfortable for my neck (no surprise) and I have shoulders a bit broader than most women.

This one feels lighter and easier to maneuver through store aisles, but the Maclaren is somewhat easier to get up and down curbs. My girls (petite sized) were about aged 2 and 4 when I used this stroller the most for mall shopping trips and park outings; however, after I learned I was expecting my third baby, I've stopped pushing them around because of the combined weight being quite heavy and hard on my hips! Now the girls are close to 3 and 5 so I just make them walk or just use shopping trolleys, but with a baby on the way I expect to be able to make use of this stroller again very soon especially with the car seat attachment for the new born stage. We had this shipped internationally to us in the UK for a great rate and found it quite easy to put together. It smelled really strongly at first, so we left it outside to air out before we used it. Also we don't particularly make use of the tray cup holder or parent organizer, but they seem to work ok and be of reasonable quality.Things we like: kids can get on and off the stroller easily; can potentially have 3 children riding it on/off for longer outings; fits infant carseat.Not so great: the front seat isn't very deep, so larger children will not be as comfortable sitting there; the basket can be hard to access, tray cup holder is really hard to take on and off (we usually just leave it off)*UPDATE - DEC, 1, 2013*I've been able to use this stroller to push a toddler, a 4 year old, and a 6 year old at the same time. The total weight is almost as much as me, so I do get a pretty good workout especially on any type of incline. My two older girls share the back by squeezing in on the seat or standing up together, but usually only for short stretches (e.g. 10-15 minutes max). They can get on and off when they want easily.

The set-up was extremely simple and took less than 10 minutes, it's simply a matter of attaching the wheels. The directions were clear and easy to understand, the stroller also came well packaged.I can't stop thinking what a perfect stroller this would be for a family with twins. While, sadly/gladly, we did not have twins we still get a great deal of use out of this stroller with our two daughters, who are 2 years apart. This stroller fits an infant up to a 4-year-old (in our case) with ease. The versatility is awesome! Your kids can face any direction: both out, both in, both facing each other, or both facing away from each other. If you don't see the beauty in this, then you obviously don't have two children yet! Sometimes siblings play and interact in a lovely manner and it's a great distraction to have them facing each other. Other times, siblings push each other's buttons and all you want is to turn them away from each other. Any variation that suits you works with this stroller!The basket under the seats is the largest we've seen in a stroller thus far, and we've owned quite a few strollers. Also, the cup holder!!! LOVE the cup holder! GREAT addition. The visors work well and function perfectly for both children no matter which directions they are facing.Finally, this isn't the first double stroller we've owned or used, so I have to say I'm impressed with this stroller's maneuvering. Double strollers are long and so they are always harder to steer by nature, it's just the way it is. This stroller seems to have looser, more freely moving and pivoting front wheels which makes it better at maneuvering. One thing to note is there is not bar at the bottom to put your foot on in order to prop it up onto a curb, you have to lift it onto a curb by pushing down on the handle bar pretty hard, so there is my only complaint. I can live with this, however. Also, the handle bar is padded nicely, but thick!All things considered, I think this stroller is a great choice. It's well designed, it folds up with TWO seats in it. It's sturdy and looks good, too. I would absolutely recommend it to expecting parents or experienced parents of twins.

I purchased a set for my first son when he was about 12 months old. We needed something to protect his hearing when he was outside and we were mowing, using the leaf blower, etc. I had no idea just how much we would use these. Hearing loss runs in my family as nerve deafness, so we understand and know the importance of protecting your hearing. Once damaged it doesn't come back and will only get worse (in our case). We use these for any outdoor activity such as using the shop vac in the garage, the neighbors mowing while we are outside, to fireworks at a public event on 4th of July. My son also likes to wear them when he rides his power wheel vehicles...it's cute. So when baby #2 arrived, we got him a set too. We use these more than we don't, since both of my boys love to be outside. My youngest, now 18 months, likes to put them on when I vacuum, as he is afraid of the vacuum cleaner. :) These protect my babies hearing and allow them to participate in activities that could potentially damage their hearing over time. I highly recommend these for any child that is around anything even remotely loud. Do them a favor and protect their precious hearing. These are adjustable and will work for years to come (infant to age 10 or so)!

We burp our son after every ounce to prevent spit-up issues, and with these you can't tell how much he is drinking without stopping, letting the air back into the insert, and then pushing it back out again.  Plus, you really can't mix formula in the bottle, so it's a pain to try to take these somewhere without having a separate container to mix in.  I guess they would work best if you use the pre-mixed formula so you can just pop a couple cans of that in your diaper bag.  Even so, that takes up extra room in the diaper bag.  Even though the bottles are easy to disassemble and wash, unlike some other bottles on the market, and have limited parts, you still have a bottle, a nipple, and a lid to wash.  As for cost, the bottles themselves are inexpensive, but you must continue to purchase the liners, and even buying the store brand it's just another cost and ultimately more stuff to throw away.  I find it's easier and cheaper to invest in other bottles that you can just wash and reuse all the parts.Pros:Baby gets less air during a feedingEasy to washInexpensive start-up costs for just the bottlesWide nipplesCons:Can't mix in the bottle so they don't travel wellCan't tell how much baby is getting unless you let the air back into the linerHave to buy liners, so continued cost after purchaseJust as many parts as other bottles so you're not saving timeOverall, I'll stick with Avent.

The aspirator requires no additional filter purchases; just use regular tissue. And cleaning is a cinch. Disassemble, run soap and hot water through the four parts, air dry and reassemble.

This particular cup was in the middle in terms of leaks. It doesn't just leak from the spout when shaken by my toddlers, but it also leaks from where you screw the lid on. Unlike the other products, this lid has a silicon ring that helps make a seal to keep the liquid in - in the week that I had these cups at least two of them had issues with the ring coming off the 'track' and thus resulting in liquid leaking everywhere. And sometimes once I got it back in place and I'd go to screw the lid on, if I screwed it too tight, it'd make the ring come off track again. So frustrating. It leaks even more if you use the straw attachment. If you have a 4 year old who doesn't throw their cup down as soon as they're done with it for the moment, or who won't shake it, this would be a fine cup. But for the vast majority of us who use this as a sippy for a younger child, this is a leaky mess.If you're looking for leak proof, your best bet is to go with the Foogo.

She's 7 months old, 16 pounds, so on the lower end of the size spectrum for an umbrella stroller.Use: She likes sitting in the stroller just fine. Up until now we've been using the b-safe car seat in her b-ready stroller and she hasn't been forward facing so riding in this is a whole new world of things to see :)Recline: The recline feature is great, she fell asleep on her first outing.Color - The color is nice, unisex for a boy or girl (we got the green)Height - I'm 5' 5&#34; and I raise the handles up as far as they can go, so not sure if i'm just weird and like tall handles, or if a taller person might have a problem. Husband 5' 7&#34; and has the same issue. They are fine for us, but I wouldn't think it would be comfy for someone taller.Walking - I do kick the wheels slightly when I walk - not sure if this is just me or if everyone would have this problem. It's not that bad, I just have to be a conscious about it.Opening - says &#34;one handed&#34; but I need two... maybe after a while of using it I'll figure out the one handed opening trick. Also it opens easily but the bottom part never locks into place automatically - I have to click each side manually. Not a big deal, but one time I put the baby in it and it wasn't locked right, and when I started walking it was all wobbly and off.Closing - very easy. It also stand up on it's own when folded which is great.Weight - very lightweight, we won't have a problem carrying it.Brakes- independent - you have to do each wheel separately.Accessories - it came with a cup holder which honestly I think popped off already and is lost somewhere.Storage - Awful - I do understand that umbrella strollers are smaller than full size and I fully expected it to be less storage area. The space is not that bad, however, the opening to put stuff into the area is really small. I can't even fit a handbag (13&#34; x 9&#34; or so) in the opening.  What would fit?

So, I was able to try out both systems and do a comparison.Day One: Daughter's \"snot\" was plentiful but very thin, almost the consistency of saliva. Used the Graco battery-operated aspirator. It worked OK at removing her \"snot\". I liked the fact that it can be operated with one hand and it plays music to distract the baby. The tip is also very soft and does not irritate the nose. She did not fight me suctioning her at all.Day Two: Daughter's \"snot\" is much thicker today. Tried the Graco aspirator first. No luck. Found that it only works to remove the thin, watery mucus. It DOES NOT remove anything much thicker than saliva. I then tried out the NoseFrida Snotsucker (available on Amazon.com). The NoseFrida was MUCH more effective at getting out the thicker snot but is difficult to use without another person. It requires two hands to operate, so you need someone to hold the baby still while you suck. You must use it correctly - as another reviewer mentioned start off with just your mouth muscles and make several quick, sharp sucks, then long vacuum-like sucks with your lungs. It really does work well.Summary: The Graco has more \"bells and whistles\" but when it comes down to effectiveness, it misses the mark. I would not re-purchase. No matter ho \"cool\" something is, if it does not do the job it was intended to do, then it is worthless.Although a bit more difficult to use, the NoseFrida REALLY WORKS. The fact that it requires two people is the only con. One person could operate it if the child was older and able to hold still, but with a squirmy infant, it requires two sets of hands. If you want a simple product that will get the job done, purchase the NoseFrida Snotsucker.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2011", "summary": "Lots of \"bells & whistles\", but does it work?

Love the idea but I guess this was just not one of those things that I really needed. Thought it would make food prep for baby easier then getting then little blender out, but it did not, just as many things to clean and takes more man power to use. It is nice for when we go to restaurants though. I have a feeling the people who said the \"grinder is too hard to turn\" did not cook the food soft enough and for those reviewers who said \"it's wobbly and gets food all over the counter\" did not tighten the handle after washing it before the first use. When tightened correctly it locks into place perfectly.I take a frozen veggie or two, heat a few pieces at a time and then add oats and formula. I can grind the whole thing with this product and even serve in the same bowl. Perfect. Yes - this is not a product for someone who wants a very fast feeding. Save your pre-packaged meals for those days. But for fresh, cooked (soft) vegetables ground into easy-to-eat texture for a little one, this is ideal. Buy it, tighten the handle well, and cook the food soft before using it and you'll really love it! As for the tray, I made several combinations of food and liked that I could store individual servings in each compartment in the tray. As other reviewers said, the food doesn't really just pop out but I slid a butter knife in and they came out fine. I'm not sure how airtight it is because there is a bit of frost on the top of the food. I really love the blue color and how it matches all the other products in the set and them stacking on top of each other is helpful for my small freezer. Overall, it serves the purpose I wanted it to.The Chop & Steam gadget is not bad either the Chopper lets you quickly chop food and steam it in your microwave. It's much easier than using knives, especially if you're still sleep deprived. Removing the chopper blade for cleaning is a little tricky, however you need to be careful. With the Mash-After your food is chopped and steamed, you put it in the grinder to make it the desired texture. The grinder is totally hand operated, so it was a little hard for me to use since I have a touch of carpal tunnel in my left hand. Since all of the pieces in the system are sold separately, you could just skip this and use a blender if you wanted. Lastly for the Store area, once you're done, Munchkin has click and lock freezer trays that you can sue for storing your food. They are about the size of ice cube trays, which ends up being the perfect portion size for your little one. They have a wonderful storage lid that prevents freezer burn and covers the entire tray so you can easily stack them in your freezer. You can also buy special storage cups and a device for making freezer popsicles for your baby.If you're serious about making your own baby food, these tools are definitely worth checking out. You'll easily regain your initial investment by not having to buy jars of baby food at the supermarket every week.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2013", "summary": "These tools are definitely worth checking out"}

I still use it to pump extra milk because I don't relish breastfeeding in public. Anyhow, it works adequately for the price. But I have recently been thinking of buying a better pump. The issues with this pump are that it only pumps one breast at a time and you must hold the pump in place. It pumps interminably slow! Seriously. I have 2 kids. I do not have time to sit there for 30 minutes PER breast in order to drain them. And the motor is very loud. My husband sitting in the same room with me has to shout in order to be heard over this motor. It is ridiculous.Other people said you must lean forward in order to drain the milk before you detach it from your breast and that is true but it isn't a big deal to me. However, the pump does start to make me feel sore after using it for a while. But I will say this in defense of this pump, I have used it almost every day for over 3 months and it is still going strong.One more word on this product. Do not think you can get away using batteries. I don't know how \"simplygo\" it is because when I tried the pump with batteries the suction was so weak it didn't draw any milk.

It weighs a lot more than I thought it would, but it's still lighter and less bulky than a regular booster. Even the clips are super thick and tough. It doesn't seem so from the photo. The material that it is made from isn't like an inflatable pool raft, it's even heavier than the material used to make inflatable mattresses. There's no way my kiddo could pop it. It's easy to inflate and I can blow it up in about five breaths in just a few seconds.

I was given two Moby wraps as gifts before he was born, and had even given a Moby wrap as a gift to a friend before I had a baby.  A few weeks after he was born I decided to try the Moby, I figured out the wrap part pretty quickly but I couldn't figure out how loose to wrap it to fit my rapidly growing baby.  After a few attempts I finally gave up.  After another few weeks I became really irritated by the fact that I had two perfectly good wraps, but that I didn't want to use them.  I contacted a woman in my town who sells all types of baby carriers (Frogmamma) and went to see her.  She showed me the Boba wrap, I fell in love.  It was the same type of wrap carrier that I wanted, but the material was stretchier (and softer to the touch) compared to the Moby.  You tie it so it is snug against your body and then put baby in, the material stretches to the perfect fit everytime.My son is now 5 months old and 16 pounds.  We still use the Boba wrap (I have two) constantly.  In those first few months it would help to calm him down during his fussy moments, which always happened in the morning.  This wrap allowed me to actually get breakfast while he would sleep.  I bought another Boba wrap and keep it in the center console of my car.  If I know in advance that I will be using it, I will put it on before leaving the house so I don't have to do it in the parking lot.  That is the only con about this type of baby carrier.

Wow, it really has been that long, and we loved it from the get go and ever since.  Yes, it is heavy as sin (33 pounds on its own - with the base included so over 32 pounds you can no longer use the LATCH system, you need to use the seat belt), but it is heavy because of it's construction.  After doing extensive research this was what we ended up going with when our daughter outgrew her bucket seat (at 5.5 months).  It wasn't the most expensive, and it wasn't the cheapest.  This had the perfect combination of safety with cost effectiveness.PROS:~ Multiple bases, simple to exchange from car to car.  It is heavy and a bit bulky to do this, but it isn't the pain in the arse fighting with the seatbelt / straps to ensure a TIGHT and proper fit for the car seat installation.  This in and of itself was a big plus for me.  So many people use their seats with improper installation without even knowing it.~ Cup holder -- seems silly when you are talking about a little bitty baby first making the transition to a convertible seat, not so much when you have a toddler.  Just trust me on this.~  Simple to switch from front to rear facing and back again.  I was working as a nanny and taking my infant with me to work.  There was one day where I needed to transport an additional toddler in my car (friend of one of the kids) and I didn't have my little one with me (she was with her daddy) and it was so easy to take my infant's rear facing seat and convert it to forward facing proper strap positioning  for a toddler in the span of under 5 minutes. And it went back to perfect positioning for my infant just as quickly and easily.  Seriously, this was a huge plus for me!~ My 90th percentile moose of a toddler was able to stay rear facing until literally DAYS before her THIRD birthday!  The safest way for anyone to ride in a car is rear facing, followed by a 5 point harness, and then high back booster (belt positioning) followed by just using the seatbelt.  The weight limitations for this are rather high compared to what was on the market when we purchased, which was a big plus for me personally.  If I was spending $300 on a seat ... I wanted it to LAST me for a while.  I won't ever have to buy her another seat (which was a huge plus for my husband!).CONS:~ My daughter is always so warm in this seat.  Like seriously, HOT!  When she was little, she would be sweated wet on her back.  I really wasn't thrilled with this aspect, but I learned to layer her and remove layers so she is dressed in light light clothing in her seat (which is actually a positive because that is safer for strap tightness and placement!)  and just layer her / bundle her up before taking her out of the car.Over all, I am beyond happy with my purchase and highly recommend this seat to anyone asking my opinion.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014", "summary": "Perfect"}

This set is a great starter kit- it came with two sizes of bottles, the 4 oz for now and the 8 oz for when baby can drink larger amounts and also drop in liners.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the set only gives you 2 of each bottle size and if you are like me and like to premake a few bottles for convenience, you'll have to buy an additional set to get extra bottles. Also, the drop in liners do have one flaw - the ounce measurements on them are not colored so they blend in and are hard to see; I discovered that they are also inaccurate and are off by 1/2 ounce.

Plus, the splash guard does a good job preventing spills. All in all, the trainer works well but not exactly as stated. When setting up the Pourty Flexi-Fit Toilet Trainer you are suppose to adjust the prongs to be a little further in from the toilet seat edge. This means to put the trainer on the toilet seat you must squeeze the rear of the trainer in slightly. The trainer then stays securely in place because the prongs are pushing against the edge of the toilet seat. However, when I adjust the prongs to be a little further in from the toilet seat edge the rear of the trainer bows up. As a result, I adjusted the prongs on the trainer to be flush with the toilet seat. Setting it up this way, the trainer does wiggle a little but is easy to pull off and put back in place because it just lifts up when taking it off and slides down when putting it back, no flexing necessary. I would have preferred the toilet trainer work as described so it would be very secure on the toilet seat.

Did not go well!  Unless you think waking up every 2 hours to calm a baby is your thing?  We prefer to visit less at nite with our daughter and this woombie convertible does the trick.  The mega size allows for our 4mo 18lb baby to have some room to stretch but is tight enough to give her the comforting sensation she needs to sleep at night.  And prior to going down for sleep or immediately upon waking up her arms can be freed if she so desires.  Access is easy, the construction is solid, especially the buttons that close the arms holes off.  Overall, this is a great product that will last us another 3 months - the stretchy material allows for some growth.  Our little girl loves to be able to put her hands together while sleeping - and this swaddle allows for it - and also keeps her tightly swaddled.  You can't go wrong with this product.  By the way, my wife and I were not fans of the infant style woombie - just seemed a strange fit to us at the time.

The bars are the same height as our bed, so it makes a great &#34;co-sleeper&#34;.  We have used an Arm's Reach co-sleeper (clear vue model) for prior baby, but gave it away.  Decided on this for new baby as co-sleeper is more expensive and only useful for very young babies - at least this can be used as a play yard later on, and is portable.  Complaints are that it was very difficult and frustrating to assemble the napper/changer the first time - probably about 45 minutes from start to finish, but very frustrating.  Once assembled it makes sense, but the instructions aren't great.  The napper/changer is not all that reversible - the plastic mechanism does not glide smoothly, the button is hard to push.  When turning it, the metal frame of the napper rubs against the mattress below and you have to apply some pressure to get it past the mattress (we do have a mattress pad and sheet on the play yard mattress, so it may be a bit thicker than the mattress alone, but were not going to put a baby down right on the scratchy play yard mattress).  So, we don't use the reversible feature - it's a napper or a changer but not both, unless your really motivated.  Also the cover of this is not removable or machine washable - spot clean only - so napper/changer requires a separate waterproof pad and sheet or blanket (bassinet size roughly).  Napper side is covered in soft sueded material, changer bottom is white plastic and sides are fabric.I like the color - dark grey and purple.  A nice departure from pink for a girl.  The floral fabric on the long sides, and the toy bar, consist of flowers in shades of purple/deep magenta/lavender/a few light blue and two shades of grey.  Floor of play yard and short sides are a vivid purple/dark magenta color.  Napper is very light grey.Pleased with it now that it is assembled, makes a nice spot next to our bed for a newborn and will grow with her needs, but don't expect to use reversable feature.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2014", "summary": "Like the napper feature but difficult to assemble first time."}

You can jiggle it side to side or bounce it up and down to suit your baby's preference. Just the baby's motion make it jiggle slightly, which she seems to like.The sides are a breathable white mesh fabric, similar to a football jersey, but a heavier, stronger gauge (but it actually looks nice, amazingly). The sides are stretched nice and taut between the padded top frame and the rigid base when you screw in those 2 screws (one on each leg). The sides are further secured with two dowel rods each. The feel is very rigid and sturdy, perfect for safe baby sleeping. No extra padding or fluffy stuff to cause a smother risk.Although it's sturdy, it's lightweight enough for it to be very easy to carry. I'm 2 weeks post-op from my c-section & still having trouble managing anything heavy or large, and this was no problem to lift over a counter and into position.It's an excellent height for seated use. I'm using it by my desk, and it's very comfortable to pick her up, nurse, and return her to the cradle without straining my back, and it's small enough to fit easily behind my desk with me. Previously, my options were a baby seat (low to the ground & hard on my back) or a play yard (too large to fit behind my desk). There's a nice line of sight between a seated adult and the baby within a couple feet.It would also be a good height for a low platform bed or futon (way too low for my high antique bed, where even the play yard bassinet is kind of a reach).A thin pad with a zippered waterproof cover is included.The only downsides are that 1) finding sheets for it might prove annoying, and 2) because it's so compact, you'll be limited on how long you can use this. It's not safe to use once the baby can roll over or push up (according to the product warning, and that seems about right, thanks to the unstable nature of the springy feet). As for the sheets, you may have luck with bassinet sheets. I was hoping the mattress would be the same size as our little Summer Infant in-bed sleeper, but no dice. I wouldn't want to go for long without sheets on this. Since the pad cover is waterproof, that would mean any wet diaper leaks could just roll off the surface of the pad and down the sides, necessitating taking the whole thing apart to clean it. Luckily, the whole bed comes off the frame with just 2 zippers, so it's not *that* big a deal.After it's too big to be safe for baby, I think it would make a great little toy bin or laundry hamper. Alternately, you could remove those two screws, put them back in the holes, and fold it flat for super compact storage.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2012", "summary": "Modern, clean & compact cradle sets up in a minute with onboard tool!"}

I keep on thinking that a better lightweight stroller might exist out there than the Bugaboo Bee, but I have yet to find it, and I've tried out a lot of lightweight, compact travel friendly strollers.Before my daughter was born, I had the time to do a lot of research and test drive strollers.  Money was no object before the baby and 2 full incomes (ha!), so I settled on the Bugaboo Chameleon as my urban, city neighborhood stroller and the Bugaboo Bee as my air and road travel, car friendly stroller.  They say that your first instinct is usually the right one, and despite my best efforts to try to prove my initial purchase wrong, I still stand by these 2 strollers as the best and only strollers that I need.  If for any reason I could only have 1 stroller though, it would be the Bee.  The Bee is Bugaboo's version of the umbrella stroller.  It is lightweight and easily collapsible, and unlike an umbrella stroller, it can be used from birth onwards, the seat can reverse to be facing you or facing outward, the handles are adjustable and one-handed pushable, the basket is really large and easily accessible, and it takes infant car seat adaptors and you can completely remove the seat when using the infant car seat so that you have even less bulk and weight.  I tried and simply could not find an umbrella stroller in the weight class of the Bee with all of these pros.  I have bought and returned Cybex, McLaren, and UPPAbaby strollers.  Simply nothing matches the Bee.What are the cons?  Well, for travel and during the summer, if you want a really great, full body sunshade, you've got to purchase the sunshade separately and attach it.  Once you have it though, believe me, there aren't any other sunshades out there that match.  You can even cover up your baby's feet completely with the extendable sunshade (the parasol, by the way, is a piece of crap - save your money and get the sunshade).  Also, let's face it - it's pricey for an umbrella stroller.  You're not going to just want to gate check it with a flimsy cover or garbage bag.  So, you're going to want to get a nice possibly padded cover.  It's worth it though!  I love, love traveling with this stroller.  Thirdly, while it handles better than any other umbrella stroller out there, it's not going to handle like a full-service stroller.  The wheels are not foam or air and the frame is meant to be lightweight.  It's going to feel more like a rickety frame stroller because that's basically what it is.  If you're looking for something to push through trails and grass and over crappy city sidewalks for miles and miles, it's simply not built for that and won't be the most enjoyable ride for either you or baby.  That's why I have the Chameleon (but the Chameleon is a pain to break down and use in the car or for air travel, so I wouldn't own it if I didn't live in a very walkable urban environment).  I use my Bee daily and simply cannot imagine life without it.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2013", "summary": "Best Very Lightweight Stroller Out There"}

We wanted something that would fit the style of our house, and not clutter the room with silly bears or nursery prints.We were excited to find the Mamaroo and ordered it without even trying it out in a store first.So here's the scoop:Pros:It looks modern. The sleek white base has a great design, and the bucket seat support is smooth and sturdy.The movement motions are relaxing, even for adults to watch, because of the way the pod moves out of the base- another great design.Our baby (who is just one week old now) enjoys the slowest movement setting, and we can speed things up once she is older. The vibrating is so very slight, but enough to be calming. She is actually napping in it RIGHT NOW and giving me time to check email, etc.The ipod feature is awesome, so we can also expose the baby to all varieties of music that we like and not tiresome nursery tunes. Nice range of sound volume too.The built-in nature sounds are good- especially the white noise.The bucket seat cover is easy to unzip and wash.The whole pod reclines for tiny people, and sits up for slightly larger people.NO BATTERIES needed. It just pugs into an outlet. The cord is about 5-6ft long.Cons:It is LARGE. It takes up about a 3ftx2.5ft space on the floor and is about 3 ft tall.The motor that runs the base movement is louder than I expected. White noise though... this alone is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I wish I had known that the motor was as loud as it is. BUT STILL A GREAT CHAIR and not enough noise to be a deal-breaker, for sure.Our one-week-old is too small to fit by herself, so we have to pad around her head with rolled up washcloths. I wish it had come with an extra head support for tiny people, like infant carseats have.The Art balls at the top are removable, and even though they are way cooler than most hanging baby toys, they are mostly stationery and purposeless. Small pro: the whole arm that holds the balls is removable too.All in all, I highly recommend this seat to sophisticated, modern parents, who don't want a winnie-the-pooh chair, or the likes, in their living room, or for parents of babies who are bored with just one type of movement, either swinging back & forth or stationery vibrating.

So I decided to try these for a few reasons...1) my friend had used them for over two years and was completely pleased2) they have double gussets3) they are not too expensiveWhat I like about these diapers:- double gussets hold most pee and poo in- both ends of the diaper are open so the insert agitates out in the wash. No pulling nasty inserts out makes me so happy- the inserts snap into the diaper so when they agitate out, the insert and diaper are connected. That way you can just stuff them right back in when they're clean- cute patterns- my baby never has blowouts in these diapers and rarely leaks (see below about the leaks)What I DON'T like:- very bulky on a small baby. They make small babies look like a pear-  my son is currently in between the snap sizes  so the diaper is either super tight where he gets terrible red lines or its too loose and he leaks. I'm sure when gets a bit bigger, this problem will be solved.- they aren't made in AmericaThese are some of my favorite diapers.

At this point in time I'm convinced that a perfect stroller does not exist.  I've had Peg Perego, Graco, Chicco, Evenflo and Kolcraft strollers.  I've also taken numerous other strollers for test drives.  The bottom line is every stroller is missing at least something that keeps it from being labeled \"perfect\".  For the Britax B-Agile, there are a few things that keep me from being able to call this a perfect stroller.For starters, I'm not a fan of infinite reclining seat backs.  No matter how easy or simple the manufacturer claims they are, there's usually something that gums up the works.  For this stroller, right out of the box it the adjust function didn't work well because the webbing on on side was installed twisted.  After talking to their customer service [who offered to replace the stroller citing the problem as unable to be fixed] and playing with the sliding adjustor and the webbing, I managed to straighten out the webbing to allow the seat back to adjust smoothly.  I suppose it's possible that the webbing could twist during repeated use.It should be noted that while you could use this stroller with a newborn, the seat back does not fully recline.  It comes close to it, but it does not form a flat surface like the Chicco Cortina does.  It does recline enough that a baby will be able to nap.I'm not thrilled with how this stroller folds.  Sure it's quick and easy, but I honestly don't see myself folding this with a baby in one arm.  I particularly don't like that this stroller doesn't stand on it's own once folded.  It's a feature that I've always appreciated in my Peg Perego, Chicco and cheap-o Evenflo strollers.  The way this stroller folds also places the handle on the ground.  I don't know about you, but I prefer the portion of the stroller that my hands will come in constant contact with to stay off the ground.  I can only imagine how dirty the handle bar will get as I fold this up in the muddy parking lot at the soccer field.The buckle on the child restraint harness is incredibly stiff.  Releasing the straps from the buckle takes a good deal of effort.  I had previously thought he Peg Perego buckles were the worst, but Britax certainly proved me wrong.  If your child is a pint sized Houdini, then this buckle should do an excellent job of keeping him or her in the stroller.The lack of a parent tray for the price of this stroller also does not impress me.  I've felt the same way about my Peg Perego strollers as well.  For what you're paying for this stroller, it would be nice to not have to buy the cup holder, too.  In my experience the add on cup holders for these higher end strollers are usually unable to hold anything other than a water bottle.The storage basket underneath is ok.  If the stroller is fully reclined you're going to have some difficulty accessing what is in there particularly if you carry a larger diaper bag.  It's not an awful storage basket but it's not the best either.I'm not a fan of the fixed height handle bar.  I'd much prefer one that is adjustable.  I'm 5'5\" and I find the height for the handlebar on this stroller to suit me nicely, but I can see how shorter or taller parents might have issues with the handle height.So what do I like about this stroller?  Well, the canopy is very nice.  It's generously sized and will certainly shield little ones from the harsh sun.  I love the peek-a-boo window on the canopy.  The flap lifts up to reveal a mesh insert which you can see through.  This design means you won't have clear vinyl that develops a hole over time or gives you a distorted view.  It also means you can actually see your child.  I have a Chicco Cortina and I'm amazed at I can't even see through the peek-a-boo window.  The rear of the canopy has a nice storage pocket which can be rolled up and secured (You'll notice that Britax was skimping on the elastic and the loop to secure the back of the canopy is not long enough to work, I remedied this with an elastic hair tie.).  Once the back is rolled up there is a mesh lining that offers ventilation.I love how smoothly this stroller handles.  I'd have to say it's the smoothest ride of all the strollers I own, so it gets high marks for that.The one touch brake is nice.  It is easily engaged and disengaged.  I like that one touch locks both rear wheels.  Since the brake isn't stiff, you can lock and unlock the brake with sandals on and not kill your toes as you disengage the brake.  It's the best brake lever that I've encountered on a stroller.The stroller upholstery is nice.  The material is a type that feels like it can easily be spot cleaned.  I'd say the fabric is comparable to what you will find on Chicco and Peg Perego strollers.  It's certainly nicer than what you will find on a Graco, Baby Trend, or Kolcraft stroller.Adjusting the height of the harness straps is pretty easy.  I like that there's no rethreading involved.The maneuverability of this stroller is excellent.  It's probably the only stroller I own where I won't wind up running it into everything in my path.  With a lighter child, you should be able to push this stroller one handed.  I tested it out with my six year old who is 43 inches and 46 pounds.  Pushing her in this stroller required me to use two hands.So how well did the six year old fit in the stroller?  Well, I'm surprised to report that she had plenty of head room with the canopy fully extended.  With it folded up her head was hitting the canopy.  Her knees were up a bit but this stroller can certainly be used in a pinch for a larger child.  She told me the seat was comfortable.Overall, the stroller isn't bad.  Depending on what you are looking for in a stroller, this one may be a great fit for you.  While there's plenty about this stroller that I don't like, I can certainly see myself using this one a lot in the future.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2011", "summary": "Nicely made, but not perfect"}

If you are, then this weather shield is for you.  If you'd like to be in the daylight, then this thing is pointless.  It doesn't let you pull the sunshades down.  There are 3 levels to your sunshade, and it lets you go 1 level which doesn't do anything.  The solution?  Put a blanket over the top?  Sure.  But...isn't the point of this to protect against the weather?  That great idea to put a blanket over this weather shield is now kaput since the wind blew off your blanket.I live in Southern California.  I am in the hills, so i needed this because:  i have the Santa Ana winds against me, occasional rain, some chilly weather at times.  During these months, this weather shield would be fantastic.  But i don't jog in the dark.  I need my kids to be able to have shade while we jog.  I used this for a week, gave it a good shot.  It's sitting in my living room.  Now i just bundle my kids up.  It's too bad, i was so excited to have this.If you need something to cover your BOB from the wind and rain, it means you really need something to fare through the elements.  This does great for wind and rain.  This product is good quality and sturdy.  That's why i even gave it 2 stars.I've read other reviews also.  It does have a funky setup.  What a chore.  I used to have a Baby Jogger single and also had a weather shield for it WHICH I ABSOLUTELY ADORED.  It was a piece of cake compared to this stupid thing.  Poor overall composition.  Not user friendly.  I think i spent more time setting this up than putting together the actual stroller.One more thing- do your kids sleep on your jog/walk?  Do you ever take one out while the other is sleeping still?  Not possible with this.  Everyone needs to come out at the same time.  It doesn't have a handy zipper or opening at the top so you can be sneaky, you have to take the whole thing almost completely off in order to get the kids out and in.If this was $25-30, i would keep it just to have incase.  But since i paid about $60 for it, it's not worth just keeping around the house.  I was thinking of returning this one and getting the sunshield instead.  I think it may serve a similar purpose by protecting a bit against the wind/rain but with actual shading.  Plus, it's not like there are many other choices for weather shields.  I wouldn't suggest this product to anyone.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2013", "summary": "Not worth the money"}

This pad is more of a beige color which is probably good, given the nature of things that end up on a baby's mattress that require a cover.2. The mattress top is quilted, but not super fluffy. I think this is good for safety, but I know some people like a soft mattress cover.3. There's not as much overlap on the back which might make it come off easier. At 3am when you're trying to get it off, that's a good feature. I'd just worry that it might come off on its own if it's being used for an older child who moves a lot.4. When washed, it doesn't look as crispy and new as the others I have do. That might be attributed to the &#34;organic&#34; nature of the pad. It doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look like it was just taken out of the bag. The fact that it's a beige color might be contributing to that look.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2014", "summary": "This seems like a decent cover, with some small issues."}

I may have the most clever toddler then, because she's figured out how to get a fistful and spill it same way as with the Munchkin cups.  Maybe instead of 20 snacks flying, I'll have 15, but none the less, a mess anyway.  Also, the clear part of the cup is rather flimsy and easily breakable.

The back is slanted with some foam, which helps the baby stay still(er). The foam is still in perfect shape for us. The bump on the bottom avoids the baby sliding down. So far this bump has been helpful (baby's 5 months old now) and doing its job. However, as the baby gets older and able to sit up, this bump will get in the way. I don't think it's possible for her to sit up. I would've preferred that the bump is removable.Also, at 5-months, she's already filling up the tub. I'm not really sure how much longer she can fit in this tub, length-wise, unless she sits up.My baby loves taking baths. Even if she were crying beforehand, once she's in the tub, she stops crying and calms down. It's like magic!UPDATE: 1/16/2013 (after almost 8 months of usage)I figured out how the baby can sit in this tub now, after seeing a friend's video of their baby's bath time. There's foam on both ends, the side where the baby lies on and the opposite end. When the baby's able to sit up, you just have the baby sit against the other end! Since around 7 month old, my baby is able to sit while having her bath. She still loves it! Now with more hand mobility, she would make a big splash every night! I think it's her favorite activity every day.After nearly 8 months of usage, the foams are still in tact, in great condition. We still don't use the music, really no need. She's already entertained by the water! Haha! Now that she can sit up, the length of the tub is no longer a real issue.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2012", "summary": "Decent tub"}

Unless you have ninja reflexes to catch the pacifier when the baby spits or drops it, the clipped straps are essential.

Backpack style is best if you are under 5'9 (straps are a wee bit short for backpack style if you are tall), but messenger style works even with my 6'2 husband.  It is highly water resistant. It is convenient for picnics, soccer games, or any activity you might spend on a lawn. Also, when folded, you can use it as a seat pad at sporting events. The cooler component of the bag seems to be something of an afterthought. It does not expand much, so you can pretty much fit only a few sippies and maybe a sandwich or two (it is not too padded, so be sure to place squishables in a plastic or metal container). There are no interior or exterior pockets on the cooler either - a pocket for ice might have been nice. When objects are placed in bag, bag takes on a lumpy appearance (again, it just isn't big enough). The front and back have minimal insulation, and the sides are not insulated insulated at all. It will keep things cool for only about 1-2 hours.  Really, if the cooler bag was just a bit deeper/wider and had better insulation (or an ice pocket), it might be more useable. It is probably best as a bag to store a few diapers/wipes, a coloring book, wallet and keys instead.

And really, your kid is not just getting a little food in the plate area, he's spreading it all over his hair (especially banana and peanut butter, really?) and all over the sides of the tray portion too, so either way you're dragging the whole thing over to the sink to be washed. If you don't get it all the way snapped in place, the whole tray will fall on the floor and your husband will utter words that are not supposed to be heard by children.My pet peeve with it is little cup holder place on the &#34;plate&#34; part of the tray - we don't own a cup that fits in there. None of the sippy cups we own fit there (and we have several) so it's really just wasted space where one could put a cup.All in all, it's ok, but if we didn't get this as a gift, we'd probably have returned it for something a little less cumbersome.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2014", "summary": "Eh (doing the so-so motion with my hand)"}

We had just started vaccinations, and as new parents, we were nervous.  A lot of reading we did scared us about SIDS. Read about Angel monitor that goes under mattress, and talked to a few people who had it.  Got mixed feedback...people liked it but said it was hard to set up and had a lot of false alarms.  We don't mind an occasional false alarm.  Better safe then sorry, but we also didn't want to think our child wasn't breathing and panic over and over unnecessarily.  This monitor is easy to put on, does not bother the baby at all - we even feed her and burp her over our shoulder at night with it on and she doesn't seem at all bothered.  It has gone off two times since we bought it.The first time was a few days after we started using. Scared the crap out of us. It is not extremely loud, but beeps like an alarm and woke us both from our sleep. When the alarm sounds, this means it has vibrated several times against your baby to attempt to get them to breath and has not succeeded. We jumped up and went to her, I picked her up, and she was breathing.  The thing is, through all of this, she did not wake up.  I think she may actually have briefly stopped breathing.  From what we read about SIDS we all stop breathing in sleep some times, and unfortunately with infants they sometimes forget to start again.  I don't know if that is true, but at any rate we felt it may have been legitimate.The other time it went off, we did not attach it properly to the diaper, it was too loose and lost contact with the baby.As parents, we feel this may be overkill, but we feel we'd rather be safe then sorry, and we found it allows us to sleep at night with a bit of peace.  Our daughter likes to push her face into the side of her crib, put her little lovey in her face, etc, and although we fix all of these things when we see them, you worry you will be asleep and she will do it again...anyway, this helps us sleep.  I'd pay a lot for that!*****Update***** We have had the Snuza approx a month and a half, maybe two months.  We use at night daily.  Tonight it was quietly beeping and I woke up to find that the battery is not low, but dead.  The beeping is a once every other second beep that is quiet and did not wake me.

I wish I had it from day one as it is very helpful in carrying baby at home. My son is 5 weeks old and Baby K'tan works great.Some pros:- very easy to use (I saw demos online while waiting for delivery and got the hug, cradle and kangaroo positions right away), I can use it much faster than buckle carriers,- the sizing is correct, right now I'm 5'6'' and around 145 lb, but my pre pregnancy size is between 6 and 8 (130-135 lb), and size Small is perfect. Although after washing and drying it shrunk and it was to small for me, it stretched out. next time I will air dry, because baby cried and it was squished. The sizing seems correct but I keep thinking if will fit when the baby will grow, but K'tan website ensures that will be ok, especially with different positions,- the material is very soft and keeps my 1 month old snuggle to me. Cradle position seems to cramp the baby but he doesn't mind, so far because of no neck control yet we both love the hug position. He is very curious and loves to see the world, and at the same time when falls asleep can be hold tight,- carrier feels very comfortable and truly hands free; it feels the most natural from all the carriers I've tried,- the sash is also a storage tote at the same time so it is easy to carry the whole thing in a diaper bag, matching hat is cute but doesn't fit my 5 weeks old yet even after washing and drying (size 0-3 months; but he will grow to it eventually),- I can do a lot stuff at home with my son next to me, he sleeps better and longer.The cons:- the description says it can be used on preemies but baby k'tan website and instruction booklet says to use from 8-42 lb (the box says 5-35 lb, so I don't know which one is right). Although I can see that would work with smaller babies for sure, especially kangaroo and cradle positions,- I can not properly position the baby for breastfeeding,- it really can hurt shoulders area so proper adjustment is a key.I've tried:-Infantino Wrap and Tie, and it is mediocre;-Beco Gemini way to big for newborn and seems a bit bulky for me (my husband and I ended up using this carrier max 5 times, takes too much time to readjust the straps, it is not easy to figure it out-it takes too much time and everybody is sweating in clothes before walk, very annoying; unsnapping is almost impossible to do it due to safety click, especially when holding the baby after unbuckling first straps), must air dry as recommended otherwise will pick up every lint from the drier, air dry takes some time too because it is thick carrier; expensive and so inconvenient,-Munchkin sling and definitely it is not for small babies, it's not stretchy and didn't feel right and safe,-and some old Snuggli my friend passed it to me, it worked for newborn and I used it till now, but it was killing my back due to the bad ergonomics of the buckle system).I highly recommend Baby K'tan and might get light color for the summer or mesh one (depends how hot it will be in black one). UPDATE: I ended up will only black carrier that was used during winter in Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas summer, worked great. During the winter I wore it under the jacket to keep baby warmer.UPDATE: my son at 11 months old, I lost some weight (128 lb now) and carrier still fits great, I don't use gemini one at all, K'tan rocks. I can take the baby in and out very fast. My son loves facing forward position to enjoy the views. Still both hands are free and I can walk my two dogs on the leashes, go to the store for some groceries and never get any back pain. Now when my son is over 20 lb it is also great work out. Highly recommended and never want to try other carriers with regulated belts ans hard to use snaps (like Gemini is pain to adjust for different positions, is akward and does not fit right, plus hard to unsnap).I bumped it to a 5 star review because it is truly the best carrier I've tried and I am very happy that I got it. Before I took 1 star because I couldn't figure out the breastfeeding position, but this actually doesn't matter.UPDATE 2: baby is getting heavier, 26 lb now but I still use baby K tan but not for super long walks, 20-30 minutes max. Awesome work out on the hills. My son is 15 months and he almost looks to big for it but it still works! Carrier looks great, still very black.UPDATE 3: soon after update#2 I realized that I don't use the carrier anymore. Baby got bigger, walks by itself and for longer distances I use umbrella stroller. But I am pregnant with second one and Ktan looks like new, waiting for being used from the very beginning!Final UPDATE: I bought new K'tan july 2013, and there are some improvements from mine 2010 version. I like new color heather grey. There's no matching baby hat (which didn't fit both of my kids anyway). The sash straps taper at the end so it's easier to tie a knot (old version was the same width for the entire length of the strap. Also the storage part in the sash is works better for me than last time and fabric seems a bit softer.I was using Baby Bjorn Miracle for first 6 months with my baby daughter and I came back to K'tan.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2011", "summary": "Almost perfect!"}

Everyone who sees it in our living room says it looks like it is the swing for a princess. I also adore the gorgeous purple color, yes you can have too many pink things and the purple gives the pink a break. My four month old has been using this since the day she came home from the hospital, and I'm happy to say that it swings her at somewhere around 12.5 pounds now just as well as it swung her at 6 pounds when we brought her home. It took my dad and my fiance about a half hour to put it together and the setup seemed pretty straight forward. The slight clicking noise the swing makes is very rhythmic and quite soft even without the music and doesn't bother me or my baby at all. It was making a kind of grinding noise for awhile last week and I was about to be very disappointed, but it turned out that the legs were too close together and moving them further apart solved the problem instantly. This swing does take up quite a bit of space, but it sits in the corner for now and the benefits it gives far outweigh the space taken up. My baby loves to watch the light show on the canopy, from only 2 or 3 weeks old she would look up and wait for it to start as soon as we put her in it. The mobile is nice in the beginning, the high contrast patterns on it attract a young infants attention, but now I wish it had brighter colors and maybe some animal shapes.  The music selection is excellent, I love the daytime and nighttime options and the music is clear and pleasant, not tinny and annoying, with a nice volume control. I haven't used the tray yet, so cant comment on it.Things I would change about this swing:The reclined seat is excellent for a newborn but now that my baby is a little older I wish you could sit it up a little more.The headrest is already getting to be too short for my baby at four months, so if it cant be moved any higher I wish it could be removable.The mobile could have some brighter, more engaging colors.All in all I'm very satisfied.Update:My daughter is 9 months old now and yes, we still use this swing!She's a little small for 9 months about 17.5 lbs and still fits in this, though I think she will end up outgrowing it by height rather than weight. The motor still is going strong, it is not making any awful grinding noises or getting louder as she grows, though recently I have  had to turn the speed up a bit. Shortly after I first posted this review my husband showed me I was wrong about the seat being unable to sit up it can and it's really easy to do. All you have to do is squeeze two little plastic tabs together in the back and pull the seat in the position you want it to go. We've used the tray, although not often, for puffs and stuff and it works well when the child is sitting up in the swing. I would still highly recommend this.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 28, 2012", "summary": "Nice Swing"}

I wasn't keen on this idea.  Nor was my daughter.  When I took her potty out to clean the bathroom floor, she told me that her potty belongs in the potty next to Mommy and Daddy's potty.  We nixed the idea of moving the potty.Then one evening while she was getting ready for bed and giving the 10th excuse to get out of bed, she stated, \"I need to go potty.\"  I didn't want to stop her if she really needed to and felt telling her to go in her overnight would probably be confusing to her.  I also didn't want her to leave the bedroom.I quickly remembered the portable potty!  I grabbed it and opened it up and told her this was her special to go potty.  She loved it and now we keep it in the bedroom for when she has to go during bedtime.The size is just right for us.  It's not too big or small and is compact enough that we can slip it into our travel bag for trips to see family and friends.I love the bags that come with it.  They seem flimsy but do the job well.  Each bag has this square liner that helps absorb liquid.  It's not as absorbent as a diaper but it does the job.  You wipe, drop the wipes in the bag and just take the handles off the sides and tie it up and trash.  The bags have a light but pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering.The portable potty plus also gives you the option to make it a seat on top of a standard toilet.  I haven't tried this option yet but it seems sturdy enough.  Parts are made of rubber that seem to help with stability and no slip.A few tips that I culled from reading the manual and speaking to other parents:1.  If you open it up to be a portable potty, make sure to snap the legs closed so it doesn't collapse on your child.  The easiest way to do this is flip the legs down and put the potty on the ground.  Put your hands on top of the potty seat and apply pressure until you hear the clicking sound.2.  If you use it as a seat over the toilet, make sure the handle bars are also locked so your child's fingers don't get caught in between the seat and the toilet seat.3.  If you use it as a portable potty, you can leave a maximum of three bags on it.  This saves you from having to re-line it every time and the occasional, 'I'm not done yet!' and plop back onto the seat after you pulled the dirty bag off move.This potty is not for the very young or for those that cannot sit upright for long periods of time.  It is a portable potty so it only has the seat and does not provide any back support.  I only state this as some folks have early potty learners.  We started potty learning early, mainly so that Mommy didn't have to use the bathroom with a baby on her lap.  Because of such, we also have a backed Bjorn potty in the bathroom.  We started using the Bjorn at age 15 months as a chair.  We started using the portable potty at age 2.Hope this helps.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2010", "summary": "In the words of my daughter, \"Awesome!\""}

The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf.  The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back.  It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.UPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning.

That way I can fit more diapers in the home bags, and use the wet/dry bags for outings. That being said, the only reason I give these bags four instead of five stars is the design of the snap handle. Generally the things I need for my son away from home for up to a few hours will fit easily in the dry section. I would therefore prefer a strap going from one side to the other so that the bag could be carried as a bag in its own right, and it would be the only bag I'd bring. (I think a long shoulder strap with a pair of snaps that can attach to a stroller would be really convenient.) It's true that the small strap is nice for over-the-doorknob use at home but for my purposes a larger strap would be preferable (and would still work just fine hanging on a doorknob).", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2011", "summary": "Does the job well"}

Fisher Price Princess Potty, Fisher Price Cheer For Me Potty, and the Fisher Price Frog Potty.  I went to a local Walmart store and found all 3.  The Princess Potty was already open so I was able to set it up on the floor to see how big it was and even let my 2 and a half year old daughter sit on it.  It was great, cute, and my daughter liked it, but I already have a potty that sits on the big potty and already have a step stool so I really didn't need that one, plus the basin/bucket to hold the contents is VERY small.  I loved the height of this potty and that it was fairly lightweight yet sturdy and that the back rest actually stayed up.  The Cheer For Me Potty was about the same as the Princess Potty but with more bells and whistles (toilet paper holder, flusher, etc) and also more than twice the price of the frog potty and about 10 bucks more than the Princess Potty.I really didn't need all the enticement to go potty since she's been peeing/pooping on the big potty and on her Fisher Price On the Go travel potty for about a year now.  The reason I was looking for another potty was to keep her out of the bathroom after my bathroom had been \"T.P.'d\" several times, and now that she is used to her travel potty (which we LOVE by the way) and it was a little too difficult for every day use (GREAT for travel/outings tho), I want to keep it in the car.  Months and months ago, she had seen the frog potty and was very upset when we didn't leave with it.  I thought it was geared more towards younger babies so I didn't even look twice at it, well, maybe I did, but for the oh so cute factor!!I'm picky about potties - I want it to be easy to clean.  Frog Potty IS very easy to dump out (just lift it off and dump, that's it) and clean.  One huge issue I kept seeing in other potties was that the basin/bucket would be flush with the surrounding seat so if a little rogue urine got on the seat part, it could get elsewhere through the crack between basin/seat.  Even the ones wit ha seat top completely over the basin, urine can still get under the seat, meaning more to clean.  I wanted a seat that wouldn't do that.  The Frog Potty is one piece on the top with a built in urine guard.  Any spraying pee will only get on that one piece.  My 2.5 year old daughter has only had this potty 2 days now and she already lifted it up after using it, carried it carefully to the bathroom, was even able to lift the toilet lid on her own, and dump the contents in, all by herself!The bucket/basin part of this potty is large enough for all kids urine, however, I wonder if it could fit a fairly decent sized poopie without hitting the bottom before it's out of the kids' hiney.  So far, this hasn't been a problem, but I did figure out a trick if that were a problem!  If you lift out the pink (or blue) basin, there is nothing underneath - therefore, to extend the life of this potty, you could easily fit a 1 gallon ice cream bucket underneath the frog and it perfectly fits around the hole that the basin sits in.  (and kiddo should still be comfy on the potty even without the pink/blue basin insert)  Yay!  Yes, You'd have to clean the inside ring of the frog potty, but it's so simply designed that it would be very easy!  And still easy to clean - lift up the frog, grab bucket, dump, and clean - woohoo!This frog stays put and is very sturdy - I can see that it might slide around a little on hardwood/tile/linoleum, but get some grippies for the bottom or just toss a rug under it and it's perfect!The backrest is a great height.My 2.5 year old daughter is 35 1/4 inches tall and weighs 29 pounds and while this potty is lower than some, she's still very comfortable on it.  (See picture)The Pink/green version's colors are a lot more subtle than the Blue/green version where the green is a vibrant green.  The pink/green version's green is more of a spring green.  Both are pretty and I had a hard time deciding which color!!So far, we love the simplicity, cute factor, and comfort at a fraction of the price of other potties!!!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2010", "summary": "Adorable, good height, easy to clean, affordable!!"}

I wanted an old school training cup for my baby so I could remove the valve, fill it with 1-2 ounces of water, and let her start to get used to how water flows from a cup without having to suck.  If you are curious about how this cup works for that purpose and/or why the heck I would do this, read on. . .We have been using the cup without the valve for about a week now, and I am really happy with it.  I am actually a little surprised at how little water it loses considering the spill proof valve is gone.  It has a circular opening behind the spout, and that seems to inhibit the flow of water anyway.  My baby is learning to tip it to her mouth to drink, but of course, she also likes to bang it against her high chair, fling it across the room, hold it upside-down, etc.  Because of the way it is engineered, it loses a few drops - but not nearly as much water as I would have expected.  It pours into her mouth when you hold it at just the right angle, and it stops when it isn't just right.  I help her get sips from it while she's learning, and I find it really easy to work with.I am doing this at the suggestion of a child development specialist who said that it's helpful in getting a child to learn how to use a real cup later.  That said, I know it may not be a great idea for everyone.  It works for us because I have the time to work with her, I don't mind the tiny bit of spillage, and I only give her water.  (Even if the cup leaked, it wouldn't get sticky.)Best of luck!  I hope you find your happy cup!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2012", "summary": "Works great as an old school training cup!"}

My mom recommended Avent bottles because my nephew did so well with them. So, listening to my mom's advice I bought a whole set of avent bottles...WHAT A MISTAKE. My poor baby was so gassy and colicy. She wouldn't let me sleep. She was always complaining and straining like she wanted to pass gas or burp. After a couple of weeks of this I broke down and asked my husband to buy me some DR. Brown Bottles and after a couple of days of use we saw a difference. The baby wasn't straining and complaining as much. She was sleeping better and she passed gas and burped easier and faster than before. It wasn't a total cure but I must admit it is a big difference than before. My baby is only a month old so her little digestive system is still working out its kinks. I bought the wide neck bottles since the nipples on these bottle resemble the Avent nipples (since my baby was already used to the Avent)No bottle is perfect and this is why I gave these bottles 4 stars:Like most people who have reviewed these bottles, my main  complaint was cleaning the extra parts but I got around doing that. I make my husband do it. So that saves me plenty of time ;)I know alot of people have complained about the bottles leaking when you warm the bottles but I found a way around that too. You unscrew the top a bit while the bottle is warming. When the bottle is warm screw the top back on and no leaks. You just have to make sure that the milk (formula or breast) is not in that the internal vent tube. If the milk is up that tube then you will have a leak. Just watch out for that.Another issue is with the powdered formula. So far my baby is on the ready made formula so formula hasn't been an issue. But soon we will be switching to powdered formula. I liked what another person suggested in one of the reviews about preparing a days worth of formula ahead of time or using another container to mix the formula and then pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles. Now I have a use for all those Avent bottles I bought!Like most people, I would recommend buying the 8oz bottles.

It seemed only logical to me that I purchase the stroller organizer to go along with the Vista.  After using it twice, I wasn't really impressed.  The positives are that it (1) fits nicely on the stroller by two side velcro straps; and (2) is convenient for storing items as it has a cup holder pocket, front open pocket (good for cell phone or anything you want accessible) and back zippered pocket (which is small, but nice for keys).  Now for the negatives - (1) The cup holder slot is fairly shallow and is really only best for a bottle of water (with cap) or smaller cup.  I took my chances with a small coffee cup and unfortunately it spilled all over the organizer (the instructions specify that it shouldn't be used with a hot beverage - I took my chances anyways, and while it held the beverage container fine, it certainly was not ideal).  I personally prefer a holder that can accommodate different size beverage containers.  It was also not an ideal fit as it only held one beverage container - something I didn't think much about before purchasing, but after going on walks with my husband and baby, two cup holders are preferable. (2) The pockets are really only perfect for a phone and keys - if you have anything larger it likely would not fit well and would best be stored in the compartment underneath the stroller.  (3) The price is a negative for me - it didn't break the bank, but it was expensive for a sub-par product (in my opinion obviously).

It has quite a few toys to keep him occupied and the assembly is fairly simple. It does not break down too much, if you want it out of the way, but you can always take the top off of the base fairly easily to get it to fit somewhere smaller.I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the little blue elephant snapped back and pinched my finger when I tried it out, I had read another review that said it could do this. If it can take an adult by surprise, 2 actually- it caught my brother as well- it will definitely get a baby. I had to unwind it a couple of times to get it loose enough to not snap. It didn't seem like it would come off, I pulled on it pretty vigorously, but I still can't recommend that anyone else do this because of unidentified safety hazards. If it had snapped my son this toy would be getting 2 stars.Also my son is 25 inches tall and 17 1/2 lbs and his feet don't touch the floor yet on the lowest setting.

I give this bag a lot of credit for holding up for as long as it has and considering I violated all the wash instructions.I will say it never once became stinky. It never let odors out -- and I never zipped it up. I used it for laundry when we travel and it worked out great. I also used it for swim lessons as a wet bag and it was great.I think every cloth diaper person has his or her own routine with what works and what she likes. I prefer hanging this from our bathroom door and dumping diapers in. I wish the opening was more wide/open as putting in rinsed poo diaper always became a tetris challenge to clear the rim.

I like both prints the same. very soft and cushy. They wipe clean easily, but also wash up great.Ease of use:As a car seat technician, I do not find this car seat much more difficult to install than any other. It's heavy, yes, but I can easilly install in several minutes (10 or so now that I am experienced with it)by myself.The straps are part of an internal harness where you just raise/lower the head support to adjust the height of straps without ever uninstalling car seat. FABULOUS!!! (I have put other children in this seat and it was a breeze to quickly adjust it for them.)Love the velcro that holds the straps out if the way while you buckle your kid in.BRITAX HAS VIDEOS ON THEIR WEBSITE SHOWING YOU HOW TO INSTALL THIS SEAT CORRECTLY!!!Oh, and if you call them, they have Nationally Certified Child Passenger Safety techs that answer the phone. LOVE that.Safety:Again, LOVE this seat. Britax is one of the best. They have so many features on their seats that you don't even know about that protect your baby its just terrific.On this seat, those giant air bladders on the side are to absorb like 45% of the impact of a side collision or something like that. They absorb force so your babies head doesn't. Then, the head support in a side collision, had great foam and padding to reduce side to side head movement. My son is 2, still rearfacing in this seat, and he uses them as pillows. He sleeps all the time in the car in this seat. I love that his head is still aligned even when asleep.If your kid is forward facing in this seat, that head support piece comes down over their head as thier head flies forward and slows the heads movement backwards this reducing injury. If you go to the Britax website they have crash test videos where you can watch this.Love that you can tether it rearfacing. Only 3 brands allow this. Britax recommends this. Mine is tethered rearfacing using Swedish method. THERE ARE VIDEOS ON BRITAX'S WEBSITE SHOWING YOU HOW TO TETHER IT REARFACING!Love the foam that compresses in a crash lowering their center of gravity!The gray rubber things on the straps not only keep the straps from twisting but also limit movement of your childs body in a crash.My specs:I have this seat (Well, I have 3 of them, one for each car) rearfacing for my 2 year old son who weighs about 27 lbs, is 35 inches tall. we have it in the center seat of my 2009 Chevy Impala using latch rearfacing tethered (Swedish), rearfacing in center back middle row seat of a 2008 Tahoe using latch and tethered Swedish, and rearfacing in back seat outboard position passenger side using latch in hubby's 2012 Nissan Altima, tethered Swedish.thoughts:I don't think this is a car seat you would want to move often, but it can be done.This is also not a carseat you can easily put three car seats across with.Compared to other seats:Of course the BEST/SAFEST car seat is one that fits your child and your car the best. But, after that, I love the safety features and ease of use on this seat.Rearfacing info:the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics)recommends your child be rearfacing until at least age 2. In Europe, children are often rearfacing to age 4-5 and they have SIGNIFICANTLY lower death rates in car crashes. My son folds his legs indian style, or hangs them over side of seat, or props them on the seat back of my car. There have been no documented leg injuries EVER from children rearfacing. I think my son will be able to rearface in this seat until at least age 3.If you turn your child forward facing too soon (for example, at a year) their necks cannot withstand the forces of a crash and their spinal cord could sever, thus internally decapitating your child. In the USA, that is one reason why motor vehicle crashes are the leading killer for kids. Our laws do not protect our kids.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2011", "summary": "I love it!"}

I'd recommend this for kids who have more sippy cup experience (doesn't throw them on the floor) in order to cut down on leaks.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 29, 2012", "summary": "fits the bill"}

Like being able to get dressed or make a coffee or do one thing without a baby in your arms. Plus, he loved it because he could do some things on his own. He jumped, giggled, reached for his parrot and frog that hang from the leaves, and so on.  I owe the Jumperoo my sanity.Two of the little toys are great - the frog spinny thing and the noise making jungle thing. The pop up tiger never was a big hit, even as he got old enough to figure it out. It would be great if they could offer little toys that you could exchange from time to time to introduce new things.

But after 4 months of using the Bjorn my back started having pain and spasms that sometimes made it impossible for me to pick up my baby.  After meeting a woman with this same carrier (she loved it, of course), I decided I had to have one.  I was very lucky to find a one day sale for this carrier at very great price (which made up for my purchase of the Bjorn).  If you are going to carry your baby with you a lot, you seriously need to consider investing in the ERGO.  With the Bjorn, my baby was strapped on top of my chest and his weight was pulling underneath my shoulder blades.  Plus, my breasts are on the larger side and they sort of stuck out on the sides after tightening the straps to secure baby.  Larger busts also make it a bit harder to buckle the carrier on, (imagine a tight fitting bra with holes cut in the cups where your breasts are supposed to be held in, THEN a baby strapped in the middle).  The Ergo allows the baby to sit lower with the weight resting on your hips.  What a relief that is!  I've been wearing it when I go out for the last 2 weeks and a couple hours at the mall is no problem.  If you're wearing a nursing shirt, you don't need to take the baby out for breasfeeding.  The hood works as a good cover as well.  When my baby falls asleep, I button it on the tightest button so his head doesn't fall back.  He is so calm and content in this carrier.  Even though he cannot sit facing front, he is able to look around just fine. It is very easy to wash(tumble dry low).  You also have the option to get the teething pads(if your little one likes to chew the straps... mine does) to reduce the amount of washes to the carrier.

I even had one for a while - until I learned better. No infant should have his weight supported by his crotch - proper carriers place the legs in a frog-like position, hugging you tummy-to-tummy. Infants require adequate head/neck support as well as the ability to tune out overstimulation - the Bjorn leaves baby hanging both literally and figuratively when in the (again overhyped) forward-facing position. As if that weren't enough, the distribution and shape of the Bjorn straps are a recipe for killer shoulder and back pain. A good carrier will let you carry on normal daily activities while babywearing - without back pain. I was so dissatisfied with my Bjorn after just a few weeks that I tossed it rather than inflict it on an unsuspecting garage saler.If you want a buckling, soft-structured carrier, go with a safe, comfortable choice like the Kindercarry, Beco, or Ergo. These carriers will allow you to carry your baby with ease through toddlerhood. I'm no athlete, but I can easily hike 30 minutes with my 32lb toddler on my back in a Kindercarry.For newborns, I highly recommend the Sleepywrap/Boba Wrap or Moby Wrap. While it takes a little practice initially, the comfort for both of you is amazing in a stretchy wrap. I wasn't as big a fan of the Moby - the Boba is more stretchy and comfy to me - but I think many folks could go either way between them.

The design is really nice, the bottles are ergonomically designed, and seem to be good quality. Nevertheless, my son hated them. He is exclusively breastfed at home and only has bottles of expressed breast milk at daycare. When our daycare provider began giving him milk in these bottles, he consistently refused them. After continuously trying to give him these bottles, we tried a few other brands and he ended up accepting one of those. According to our daycare provider, he seemed to dislike the wide base of the bottle. I was very surprised considering how much everyone else loves these bottles.

Have I had this happen to me? Yes. Have I fixed it? Yes. If you look at the nipple, there is a small seal at the lip of the nipple which is what PREVENTS leaking.If you're bottle is leaking? Unscrew and try again. Test it by shaking the bottle over the sink (this saves you from messy babies!).If it STILL leaks, then I suggest you need to replace the nipple and/or a new bottle screw ring.What different about these bottles than the normal bottles?  Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Bottles, Pink, 3 Pack There is an extra valve ring to help seal.If any of my Avent bottles leak, I follow the steps above. Never had it leak twice in a row on me. I have used Avent bottles with my son (2) and my daughter (4 months). With him I got frustrated about the leaking UNTIL I found someone else's review sharing this information. Please keep it in mind. As with all products, there can be \"user\" error at times. I am sure some leaking is the actual bottles fault, defects do happen.Also, why Avent? You can convert the bottles to a sippy cup with ease. LOVE THAT FEATURE!I don't use Avent bottles for \"newborns\" until like 1-2 months old (also I have established breastfeeding on both my children) so I can't speak to the size 1 flow nipple until that time period.
