I was able to pick up on Amazon a set of the diamond bits that fit this (my Dremel takes larger bit) and so far very satisfied.  You do have to push the button continuously when engraving.

Evans", "helpful": [1, 1], "unixReviewTime": 1106265600, "reviewText": "I have to agree with many of the other reviewers who like this router for its smoothness, power,and low noise level. The grips are great, it plunges nicely, and the quality of materials seems top rate. However, my experience with this router has revealed two flaws that greatly detract from what would otherwise be a truly fine machine. While these flaws are not necessarily deal-breakers, those of you who are considering buying this tool may want to be aware of them.First, as another reviewer has pointed out, it is impossible to accurately center template guides within the base plate. The user must screw the template guide holder into the baseplate, and since the holder does not precisely register into the baseplate, it is thus extremely difficult to accurately center the guides. If you use template guides and require even a moderate degree of accuracy, this flaw is a deal-breaker. Do not buy this router. On the other hand, if you never use template guides or plan on parking this baby in a router table, you'll have no problems. This would be a fine router for those purposes.The other problem is another quality/design issue that can be remedied but is a moderate annoyance. On my machine, the release/locking lever for the plunge mechanism came loose on several occassions, making it impossible to plunge and lock the router at a desired depth. There is a small set screw in the lever mechanism that works loose and has to be constantly  tightened and adjusted. This problem is not an isolated incident as it also has occured with two other cabinetmakers and their identical routers in my shop. In the end, having tired of constantly fiddling with our machines, the three of us adjusted the mechanisms as best we could, applied Lock-Tite to the set screws, and hoped we did it right because there would be no way to disassemble the levers once the Lock-Tite cured. Fortunately, the fix worked fine, and all three of us are happily using our machines without any problems. Again, not a deal-breaker and the problem was fixed, but this seems unnecessary for a $200 router.The other router to consider in this price range is the DeWalt DW625 3 HP plunge router. Though it has more power than the PC 8529, it is the same size and weight. It's also variable speed and would be great in a router table. I've never been a huge DeWalt fan (many of their products seem overrated and overpriced), this seems to be an excellent machine. Several of the guys in my shop own them and use them for the dual purposes of plunge operations as well as major hogging through lots of material (the extra hp makes a big difference).

Even in a fast cutting mode, it cuts reasonably smoothly.  Of course, I was easy to impress: I had been using a Craftsman jigsaw for years, and never knew what I was missing.  Obviously there's no going back now!  Having read the reviews, I had very high expectations, but the Bosch performed even better than I expected.For a regular woodworker, this saw is a great complement to a table saw.  The table saw excels for straight cuts and quantity cutting. This one is great for irregular or curved cuts, materials not suited for a table saw (e.g. metal), or cutting things you can't bring to a table saw (like a wall).I think the versatile jigsaw is a great choice for an infrequent carpenter or handyman, or someone on a budget.  For years a jigsaw was the only saw I had, and I built many useful things.  The main reason for other saws is that they may be faster or cut more smoothly (and a few things you can't do with this one, such as grooves or mouldings).While any power tool can cause injury, it's clear that a jigsaw takes longer to do serious injury than other power saws, so in that sense it's safer.  For this reason my wife is willing to use it.Using a straight-edge as a guide, you can still do a good job on long straight cuts with a jigsaw if you don't own a table saw.  I made a simple jig - a scrap of 3/4&quot; pine cut to a width equal to the edge of the shoe to the cut edge of the saw, approximately 1 1/4&quot; but varies with the blade - which, when placed along the cut line, makes it quick to place then clamp the straight edge.  To make it, clamp a straight edge to a work surface, place a straight scrap snug against it and clamp, then cut with the Bosch saw.  Mark the purpose of the scrap and store it near the saw.Nits: I don't like the non-intuitive blade change, and have had to remind myself by re-reading the manual when I had not used it for awhile.  The blades aren't cheap, but are of very high quality.  There are a LOT of choices in the blades, and unfortunately Bosch does not explain the particular advantage of one vs a similar one very well.These nits would have led me to give 4 1/2 stars, but overall they are small nits: once the right blade is installed for a job, this is a one beautiful tool.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2004", "summary": "Wow - high performance and versatility in a portable saw"}

So I was very excited to get a new and improved lumens version. If you didn't have a previous revision(60 lumens), then you should be very happy what what you are getting. I am, on the other hand, not so much. It is brighter, no question about it. But Petzl is loosing me on two things.First, the tint of the new \"White\" is slightly purple. 10 years ago I would be happy as a clam with this tint. But in this day and age it's a little strange that a respectable company such as Petzl is doing it. It's not horrible by any stretch of the imagination, just a little disappointing. On the other hand, most people won't even notice it.Second, the new \"Red\" is very, very dim comparing to the previous revision. It's usable, just not as useful as the older revision.Having said that, I am going to keep this headlamp because I got it for a song(well, kind of), and one can never have too many headlamps (yeah, right).A word of advise. Unless you are a treehagger, and I am saying it in the most endearing way possible, avoid reachargable batteries and Petzl Core rechargable battery. Why? Because your 80 lumens headlamp will perform like a 50-55 lumens headlamp with those low voltage batteries. I suggest either Energizer Lithium or better yet, new and awesome, Duracell Quantum batteries. Check your local Costco or Sams Club for the best deal on those things.Oh, and that whistle that is a part of the strap. I wouldn't count on it if my life depended on it.Nothing is perfect in this world and this headlamp is not either, but it's much better then most in the same price range.

Without the wifi, the set up was easy enough, no different than most units, I didn't even have to read the instructions for most of it.The wifi however, that's another story.  It works, yes.  But it was so fussy to set up.  The app on the iphone kept hanging up, it seemed not to be working, restart the process.  Eventually it got on the network and was able to connect.  Since then it's been 99%.  From anywhere I have internet access, I can see the temp in the house, and control the HVAC, it's nice.  The app is free, and works, but all you get is live info, no historical, no programming, but it suits most.  The computer app that you can also install also works, but you can't change anything, only monitor.  From the RTOA website you can do a bit more like set up the 7 day program, easier than on the thermostat it self, too bad the local computer can't do it quite so directly.  All of this depends on the internet being available, the connection the computer, thermostat and iphone all make is to RTOA's servers, not direct to each other.  So if you're internet is out, even on the same network I don't believe it works (but then the remote control issue is fixed by walking to the thermostat).Over all, for the money, it does the job.  It's a relatively small premium over other 7 day programmable thermostats to get the wifi/internet control of the thermostat.  What would be a nice bonus would be email alerts if the temp drops below or goes above certain values, and programming from the iphone would be a nice bonus too.Update:  The thermostat has been 100% trouble free, the app has gotten better with in app programming, widgets and other niceties.

I will add the disclosure that the Mag is much older and not LED (and I paid around $30 for the Mag).

The glass shades arrived intact and are very nice looking with faint swirls around the circumference.  Overall, this lamp looks much more expensive than it really is.  it is well weighted and not tippy.  The reading lamp is mounted on a gooseneck pole so it can be adjusted in any direction a person would find suitable.Not sure why a few others complained it was difficult to put together because I had it up and running in about 10 minutes.  The pole sections fit together tightly and there is NO wobble as with some other inexpensive halogen torchiers I've had in the past.  A tool is included for first loosening then tightening the nut that keeps the smaller shade in place.  The reading lamp uses a candelabra-base bulb (a very bright 40-watt incandescent bulb is included while the primary, standard-base  bulb is not.  I prefer \"soft sunlight\" bulbs so had to order one to fit the reading lamp portion.There is a descrepancy in the description relating to the light switch(s).  The description indicates there are two rotary switches, one for the reading lamp and another 3-way switch for the main lamp.  I've sent a note to Amazon to correct the description as there is just a single 4-way switch.  First position is reading lamp on, 2nd is main lamp on, 3rd is both lamps on, and 4th is off.  I actually prefer the 4-way since I will be using cfl daylight bulbs which are neither 3-way or dimmable.My one and only design complaint does relate to the switch.  It is located just under the large shade and is too high to be reached while seated.  I need to select which setting I want prior to sitting down.  Small point and just a minor inconvenience and I will not deduct a star for it.I am extremely happy that this is not a halogen torchier which can get very, very hot during operation.  As with some other \"incandescent-style\" torchiers the bulb does not lay sideways but the base allows it to stand straight up thus allowing for higher wattage cfl bulbs.

First up, don't buy the turbo snake from its online site, or on the phone.  Like all these pitchman products they slaughter you with the S&H, and you can do much better here on Amazon.  The turbo snake, like this product and many other variations on Amazon are basically a thick flexible nylon or plastic strip around 18\" long that have some kind of teeth at the end designed to grab and extract the hair and gunk that gets caught in the trap of bathroom sinks and tubs. Most of the products you will see here on Amazon,(including the turbo snake) claim they are for one application only. (Something they fail to mention at all in their infomercial). Be advised this is a gray area.  ALL the products of this type can be used more than once if you have a strong stomach, or are just plain cheap.  The reason why drain cleaners such as these tell you to toss it out after each use is because the prickly system of teeth employed at the business end that is responsible for grabbing the hair and gunk is very hard to clean. The teeth tend to hold on to its yucky prize most tenaciously. You will be forced to use your fingers diligently to dislodge the crap, which a lot of folks will cringe at. And in the course of the cleaning you may get carried away and break a few of the sensitive teeth, thus making it a little less efficient each time.  Still however, if you're willing to do this, and or feel that a little disgusting chore comes about easier than $$$, you can accomplish it and use each of these tools at least a couple of more times.  The other reason why products such as these tell you to throw them away is because after each use the flexible rod gets bent and twisted a little, thus a tad harder to operate.  Not impossible or greatly damaged, but a little misshapen.  Certainly not does it get so bent out of shape after one application that it becomes useless to be sure.  One has to decide for oneself if they want to use this tool once and buy in multiple units, or perform the disgusting deed.  As for the tools effectiveness, let me say first off that I have owned 3 different versions of this type of unclogger and have found them all to be of great use in getting to the clog and effectively extracting the crap.  There is only a very small or moderate difference in all of them.  Mainly in the design of the teeth. All of these tools are designed for clogs at the trap, and very close to the sink or tub. That means they are unfortunately a little short, around 18 to 24 inches, and designed only to turn the corner of a bend in the sink and that's it.  If you suspect your clog is a little deeper, you will either have to purchase a longer snake, or call a dreaded professional.  Other than that, this product, and all of them I have tried like them are both very effective, AND reusable if you are willing and accept the terms described beforehand.  I cannot recommend any one over the other since all of them seem to be equally effective despite the small differences in design.  My only recommendation would be that if you are going to be one that passes up on the squeamish cleaning and use once, buy several of them at a time and make the shipping charge worth it.  Trust me, these little tools work much better and are far easier than removing a trap underneath a sink or tub to get at a clog.  Which for me, always and relentlessly no matter how careful I am or how much I tighten it, means they leak forever more...", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 30, 2009", "summary": "Works...And Reusable....Like They All Are...Read"}

It helps to be certain that the holes are well marked before making the cuts with a good drywall saw so as to avoid oddly shaped holes and out of plumb work.  Of course, you can patch it up afterward, however that takes time.  I might mention that I looked at mounting brackets at my local hardware/lumber mass merchandiser when I did the installation and found their solutions to be about 4 times the cost and inferior in quality and utility.  (They just happen to have orange as one of their corporate colors.)  It did take a few days for UPS ground to deliver, however it takes a while to do all the prep work and get the cable runs in place anyway, so you'll likely be just about ready for them when they arrive.

The *only* downside is the price, but one gets what one pays for.  Note, it comes in a Festool Systainer box which is well designed and provides space for extra pads and adhesives.For those who are unfamiliar with Festool sanders, the design is quite unusual when compared to sanders from big box stores: the adhesives attach to intermediate \"cushions\" via velcro-like attachment, which in turn attach to the sanding pad via velcro together with a centering snap.  this is a must with Festool, because of the costs involved (you're not going to find these parts at wally world, folks.  so when you chew up the intermediate cushions on the delta pad, you only replace the cushion for $14 rather than the whole pad for $50.I'm too cheap to buy the Festool vacuum that attaches to Festools, so i bought the 1 1/4\" attachment hose for the shopvac - which works fine with the Fein 921072K13 Step Adaptor ($6.32 @ Amazon).

Farnsworth", "helpful": [0, 0], "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewText": "I used to carry around a little spyderco knife but it has a fatal flaw: it's too expensive and I can never get it back to factory sharpness.  Sharpening knives is a total hassle--I've spent too much time doing it and it never comes out as good as I want.  Anyway I used to carry around a spyderco but for simple things like opening packages or cutting anything that's not soft, I wouldn't want to use it for fear of dulling the blade.  I got frustrated with the dilemma after a while and wished there was something like my utility knives that I use to cut anything and everything without worrying about it.  Then I found this product.  What a great idea!  I now use this for an every-day carry knife.Features of this product that I like:===============================* Nice big interchangeable blade.  I use it any time I want to cut something...anything.  Doesn't have to be a high-quality target.  I don't worry about dulling it because the blade and easily and cheaply be swapped.* Good quality blade comes with it.  It's quite sharp and it's very thick...much thicker than the blades you would pick up if you just went to a hardware store and grabbed the first set you found.  I've read reviewers that said it doesn't work as well once you put in the &#34;standard thickness&#34; blades.  I'm fine with getting the thick stuff because it's strong against lateral stresses--more like a regular pocket knife.  You could use this knife to, for example, whittle.  I'm not sure I'd use a regular knife for whittling because it would dull too fast.  I wouldn't use a regular utility blade to whittle because it would bend too easily.* Locking mechanism works great.  It stays open and won't close until you push the locking mechanism aside.  That won't happen by accident, it's easy to do, and unlocking it doesn't endanger the fingers thanks to the little finger guard they have there.* Build quality is quite good.  It's heavy, shiny, and smooth.  The resistance to opening is appropriate.  That is, it's easy to open when you want to but the blade doesn't just fall open in your pocket or elsewhere.  There's a real light click when you open it and then smooth operation until you get it fully open.  I don't open blades with a single hand, so I don't sympathize with people who want really easy-opening.  That would be dangerous.* This tool is about as small as it can reasonably get and accommodate the blades it uses.  I have heard someone say the pointy end of the blade pokes out beyond the handle.  I haven't seen that...must be a different brand of blade that person was using.* When the knife is closed, the blade doesn't come in contact with the handle anywhere, so it's not getting dull or developing notches.* Fit in the hand is good.  I mean, it compares well with a pocket knife.  I don't put my finger on the little metal thing that holds the blade in.  I think if I did, I would find this uncomfortable to hold.  As it is, it's real nice.  Mind you, it's not the kind of ergonomics that I would require if I were cutting things all day.  But remember, this is a replacement for a pocketknife (seldom used) not a utility knife (used all day by some people).  I would never cut carpet or shingles or something with this.  I wouldn't even use it if my job were to open boxes all day.  This is for occasional use.  Use it in place of a pocket knife.Couple of things that could be better:================================* I don't understand why knives like this have clips.  I always carry it low in the pocket and the clip is just in the way.  The clip comes off very easily (though it is destroyed in the process).  Simply bend the clip out then push it in a little.  There's a little hook on the inside of the handle where the clip attaches and once the clip is bent it pops right out.  I have removed and disposed of my clip.* Underneath the clip the level of the handle and of the knife-holding mechanism isn't quite flat.  It doesn't affect anything but aesthetically I would prefer if it were flat.  Minimal is good but it has to all match up.* This knife is made of surprisingly thick and heavy metal.  It weighs a lot in the pocket...as much as larger knives of other brands.  Maybe that's because of the all-steel construction.  Anyway, it's heavier than I'd like.  Maybe they wanted to make it lighter but the resulting knife wouldn't have enough strength or something.* I would have liked to have had a hole drilled somewhere so I could put it on a lanyard or even keychain.  It's a bit heavy for that, but overall I think that would be a more likely use than the clip it comes with.  I have looked around for a place that I could safely drill and use but there really isn't one in this design.  Maybe if the main hinge had a hole in it or something.Closing Comments==================I kind of alluded to this a little bit above: This is a pocket knife.  Not a replacement for a Stanley utility knife or competitor.  It does a great job being minimal in the pocket and working in a pinch for occasional light or heavy duty.  Everyone I have seen who have given this a bad review did so because they wanted to use it professionally, cutting drywall or carpet or something.  For those uses you want a full-sized utility knife with much better ergonomics.  Also those full sized ones allow the blade to come out only partially, if you want to make shallow cuts.  And they carry spares and stuff.  There are lots of things a utility knife should have that this does not.  I do not consider that a problem.  This is a pocket knife.  There are few or no things that a pocketknife has that this lacks.I recommend this to anyone who currently carries a pocketknife around and sometimes doesn't use it because they don't want to dull the blade.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014", "summary": "Such a great idea!"}

The outer finish is smooth but not slippery, and has a dull finish typical for stainless steel. The hinge moves easily. The knife is made of stainless steel and appears to be of good construction. A non-removable clip is attached for use on your pocket or as a money clip.Opening the knife does take two hands and there is no convenient place to really grip the blade holder when opening, so you do have to pinch the blade holder tightly when opening. Just be a little careful when doing that.I do like that this tool uses standard utility knife razor blades as I have loads of them around the workshop, including carpet hooks and serrated blades. The included utility blade is indeed razor sharp. Blade replacement requires a screwdriver or small coin to remove the holding screw. When open, about 3/4 of the blade is exposed, giving a cutting edge of 1-1/2 inches. The hinge looks like it is removable with a spanner-type driver, but I'm not going there unless the hinge somehow gets hung up.The tool fits nicely in my hand, and the blade finger guard is nicely placed. The blade liner lock works fine. Small enough to be a nice EDC. Other specs as noted in the Amazon description seem to be right.A pretty good deal for the price (which has increase $3 since I purchased it).Nits: (1) The blade holder should have a small thumb indent on at least one side to make it easier to open. The metal there seems to be more than thick enough to accommodate that. (2) blade replacement requires removal of a screw on the blade holder. The screw is not captured and needs to be completely removed in order to replace the blade. Small and easy to lose. (3) the liner lock on my tool gives a little double click before locking in place.

But, the battery only lasted 45 minutes. Then the problems started. The 1/16 inch grout bits only lasted a few minutes then broke. I had better luck when I was removing 1/8 inch grout because the 1/8 inch bit lasted for hours before it started getting dull. Since the grout bits are not well made, I found another brand that cuts much better, much cheaper in price, and last longer.I HAD to get the grout removed and this was the only tool I found that would do that. But, after a few days the Dremel broke. I still had grout to take care of, so I bought a corded Dremel to continue the work while the cordless was sent in for repairs. To the credit of Dremel, the cordless was promptly repaired and returned along with a free accessory for my trouble. I started using the cordless again and it stopped working again. This time it just stayed on fast speed. So, off it went to the post office again to send in this thing for repair. It is repaired again, but this time I am using the corded Dremel.I also tried the tool on other jobs such as removing paint from a window frame, sanding a small section of wood, drilling a pilot hole for a screw, and cutting off a screw that I could not remove. What I found was that the Dremel did a fair job if you have a steady hand. However, some of the accessories either break easily or grind down quickly. And these accessories are not cheap. You can easily spend 3 times the price in bits and accessories than what you pay for the tool itself.The bottom line is, this thing is mostly good for small work such as crafts. But, can also come in handy when a large drill or sander just will not fit. Just stay away from the cordless.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2005", "summary": "Cord or cordless?"}

You don't worry about losing power and charging the battery.  Your workbench won't be clogged up by the charger or one socket is occupied.Without the battery the drill bit being held on the drill is exposed a bit.  It can scratch you as shown in the picture.The bag is actually a good idea as I don't need to spend time putting the drill back in it's case and wind the cord.

Still, I know what a very good drill is; my drill before last is pretty good.]The drill itself is like most drills, powerful enough because of the absence of battery, reversible at the push of a slide switch.  Variable speed and hence power is controlled by the switch.  It's good in the sense that my last cordless has a dial of 10 positions for drilling and driving.

Turns out that the float that shuts off the water after a flush no longer turned off the water so it would just drip a bit, or run a bit, or make a really loud pressure noise at times (like the middle of the night when you need a really odd, loud, unfamiliar noise the most).A little research showed that this is a pretty common problem with some Toto's (Toto Carlyle II model in our case) and this is the universal fill valve that replaces many Toto fill valves. This one on Amazon was about half the price of the Toto website and it came in a genuine Toto box so all looks legit.The Toto directions are mostly clear and you could do most of the job without any directions, it's pretty much common sense. But, you need to lookup your toilet model number on the directions to know what height to set it at (it's adjustable) and how much to set the water pressure knob at (it comes with a key you use to set that). It's that key that isn't clearly explained but you basically find your number on the chart, find that number on the key, place the key into the knob and turn it until a it hits the key...essentially you are using the key to set a gap. Once you understand that it's all quite easy and you'll have it replaced in 10 minutes.No tools are needed to put in the new valve but you may need a wrench to get the old nut off the old valve when pulling out the old unit. Other than that it's easy and has worked great ever since I installed it.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 27, 2013", "summary": "Finally, a fix for that nearly new yet leaky Toto toilet"}

The ratchets, sockets, and socket accessories are heavy, polished, and strong.  The wrenches are a bit thinner and lighter, but still acceptable.  The screwdrivers have nice, ergonomic grips and well defined heads.  The allen wrench and driver bits are standard.  But my impression of the adjustable wrench, adjustable pliers, and long-nosed pliers is slightly less good:  the adjustable wrench is forged, the adjustable pliers is a little stiff to adjust, and the handles on the two pliers are not my favorite type.Here are some other points worth mentioning:1)  This definitely strikes me as a set you'd keep in your car in the event of a breakdown.  It leans heavily toward mechanic's tools rather than homeowner's tools.  In fact, my general feeling is that there are too many similar sockets taking up space where some more diverse tools might be in order.  If this is your main set of mechanic's tools, than it might make sense, but I suspect most people really into working on automobiles might go with an easily-augmentable set (i.e., that doesn't come in a blow-molded case of this sort).Specifically, for emergency tools or for a more amateur set of tools, it is not imperative to have three different drive sizes, especially because many of the socket output sizes overlap.2)  The 3/8&#34; drive sockets are 12-point, while the 1/4&#34; and 1/2&#34; drive sockets are 6-point.  This appears to be normal, although I'm not entirely sure why.  I assume it's because it requires little effort to use 3/8&#34; drive for everything, where if you are an aficionado or concerned about rounding bolt-heads, you'll switch between drive sizes and always use 6-point sockets.  This sort of reinforces my point number 1, above.3)  Spark plug sockets decrease the amount of metric deep sockets you get with the set.4)  It's nice to get some standard screwdrivers instead of having only the changeable bits.  On the other hand, this is also not strictly necessary overlap.5)  Hex wrenches and screwdriver bits are always going to be sort of a pain to get at in sets like this.6)  The only 1/2&#34; drive socket included that is not a duplicate of those available in 3/8&#34; drive is 21mm.7)  Since the handle does not fold, the plastic clips holding the case together at the top are not super-easy to access.8)  The clips can actually fold in and the case sides can fold in and rest on them.  This can be annoying when you're trying to close the case, but it might be on purpose to make temporary closing of the case easy.I like these tools.  I will feel good knowing they are in my car should a breakdown occur.  And that is the use I think this particular set is best suited for.

Here are the positives:First, the bag has a very solid and not very flexible bottom to it.  This is a good thing since it actually provides some structure to the bag, especially when you place heavy tools (3 pound hammer, 1/2 inch commercial drill, two 18V battery packs and two commercial 18 volt drills).  The bottom is made of heavy rubber which makes it nice for using on a construction site as it will stand up to a lot of abuse and does not get your tools wet if the surface you are placing it onto is wet.Second, the handles are made of webbing that is securily sewn into the sides of the bag!  There is no shift of material when you lift a heavy load.  You can grab the bag quickly and swing it up onto a bench or other item without worrying if it will fall apart!Third, the canvas material that the bag is made of is very heavy and appears to be water repellent.  Taken out in a light rain water only beaded up on the surface.  I have not tried leaving it out in the rain and would not recommend that.  But, when you have to make a dash to your vehicle and the weather is not cooperative, this should help to keep things dry.Fourth, the bag has several pockets, both inside and on the outside, that you can fit tools and such into.  The only down side is that there is no way to secure any of the pockets.  However, things such as electronic levels, tape measures, drill bit sets, etc., seem to stay in place without any problem.Finally, the red of the strap material helps to keep you from accidentally leaving this bag behind!  Black has a way of just melting into the background, especially when you are in a hurry.  The straps on this bag really stand out and help to keep you from leaving it behind on a job site.Now, for the bad aspects;First, there does not appear to be any way to lock this bag.  So, it is not as nice on a job site as a locking tool box.  Still, it is more flexible in what you can place into it.Second, as I mentioned above, there is no way to secure any of the outside pockets.  This means there are NO closures for any of the pockets and anything that fits loosely can fall out!  You might want to stick to only using the inside pockets unless what you are placing in the outside pockets fits REALLY securely.All in all, this is a nice and flexible addition.  I can easily stick a 100 foot power cord into the bag for job locations where it is needed.One final comment, there are NO wheels on this bag and I am very glad of that!  Apparently, there is another bag from this company that has wheels, but this is NOT it!!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2010", "summary": "Soft sided replacement for tool box"}

Don't expect to get good results with a tool that references the base to a flat surface when the tool rocks back and forth on its base.  Yes the issue can be resolved with enough elbow grease.  Just apply spray contact adhesive to the back side of coarse grit sandpaper,and stick it to the flat surface of a cast iron jointer table.  Then rub it flat, and reattach the somewhat less than sturdy aluminum base plate.  I just don't like having to do makeshift finishing work on a poorly manufactured tool.  And no, I didn't send it back for an exchange (not purchased from Amazon).  It only took the better part of one day to flatten the base.  It would have taken two weeks for an exchange, which may or may not have been from the same production run with the same exact issue.  Who knows?In summary I have been duped by advertizing to expect that tools with DeWalts name on them should perform reasonably well out of the box.  This one did not.

Heck, this is a very good vent! It has been functioning without a hitch for over a year now. This is a very nice design, and I like the fact that it is closed shut when the dryer is off. It is also easy to clean if you need to (just take the lid off and knock yourself out). Also, I don't know why, but I think it looks nice, nicer that those flappy ones, more \"high-tech\", but maybe it's just me...BUT, this is not without faults.First of all, it needs to be painted - why the heck don't they just make it white and then I will paint it other color if I need to? Weird... Other reviewers downgrade this issue, but unless you have some skills with that spray paint you'll end up with an ugly looking vent with drippings and such. And why do I have to spend 4 more dollars on a good can of paint when I shouldn't?But the main issue is that this vent comes without any tail piece or sleeve or anything to install it with. How much more would have cost a 1-foot aluminum pipe with a 4-inch plastic collar ?!? I will tell you how much is going to cost you: a few bucks - go to your local Home Depot, Lowes or other hardware store and buy the cheapest through-the-wall dryer vent and use the parts that come with that one (similar to this one:Lambro Industries 4' Wht Dryer Vent Hood 224Ws Dryer Hood Vents). I have cedar wood shingles, and any installation without that pipe would have been pretty nasty unless I was willing to use 50 tubes of silicone to caulk all those cracks and wholes and crevices in my aging siding...But in the end it installed very nice and secure (it's build off of very solid plastic, which is nice, so it doesn't crack when tightening the screws during installation, or when prying off or replacing the lid during cleaning).Anyway, this is a very good vent but I feel forced to give it 4 stars.

I have posted pictures of how I set mine up.I basically threw away the instructions after reading through it once to get the basic idea of how the parts fit together. I then assembled the stationary subassembly part of the table and test fitted it to my saw. I then marked the 4 holes to be drilled and where I would need to add a horizontal brace along the lower part of the table saw stand. This brace I made out of a 2x4.I then disassembled the parts and started assembling it directly to the table. The pieces have a lot of adjustment built in by using slotted holes, so as long as you get the 4 holes drilled in the right place on the table saw, you can get it aligned. Precise alignment (as suggested in the original instructions) was not needed. You do have to be careful though to align at least one slot for your miter/cross-cut slide. I don't need both channels, but if I did I could cut out a section of the stationary table top with my router.Once I got the metal pieces bolted in place, I again test-fitted the stationary table top piece to make the final mark for cutting off the edge so that I had clearance for the fence slide. After making this cut (allowing for about an 1/8th inch fence clearance), I assembled the stationary top in place, aligned it and checked for flatness and tightened the bolts.Adding the big folding table to the hinge was then trivial and required no adjustments or cutting. You also don't need 2 people, because one end can rest on the floor while you insert the screws. My TS300 is on a wheeled stand, so the vertical brace is not long enough. The simplest solution was to just put a wood block under the vertical brace made of glued 2x4 pieces. Problem solved.This is a really great table extension and I'm very happy with it. It converts my TS300 into a professional level saw. The extension also doesn't get in the way of using my Bench Dog router extension.

{"reviewerID": "A3CG6YLYZJXQG4", "asin": "B0017L37YC", "reviewerName": "Tracy Rowan \"dargelos\"", "helpful": [99, 101], "unixReviewTime": 1253836800, "reviewText": "Look... toilet seats are a fact of life for most of us, and frankly I don't think its asking a lot for them to be reasonably comfortable, durable and easy to clean.  But apparently toilet seat manufacturers do because I have had seat after seat that simply didn't stand up to those basic demands.One of the problems I've found over and over, is that the bolts that hold the seat to the toilet tend to loosen up over time, so that the seat shucks around on the toilet.  This was particularly bad when I was caregiving and my elderly charges moved around quite a bit.  But honestly, in the course of doing whatever business you have to do when you're sitting on the toilet you're going to move around, and the more play the seat gets from the bolts the more likely it is to start to slide.  (I'm not kidding you when I tell you that when I bought this seat at the hardware store, there were three other people there, all looking for a toilet seat that either didn't loosen up easily or was easy to tighten.)  If you don't tighten the bolts constantly, the supports on the underside of the seat will eventually slip off the toilet rim and then there's a very real possibility that the seat will crack.  Anyone who has ever had to sit on a cracked toilet seat will tell you that they bite.Another problem is cleaning the hinge area.  Unless you're one of those rare people who passes strawberry ice cream instead of the usual digestive products, cleaning the seat area can be a nasty business.  Sometimes, for whatever reason -- maybe one too many chili dogs, or the kids gorging on their Halloween candy. I'm trying hard to be delicate here, but still convey useful information -- things don't make it into the bowl, but find their way to the underside of the seat and the space behind it where the bolts are, which means that the nuts that you have to tighten regularly may well be soiled, too, making the whole process really unpleasant.However, the Bemis seat with its easy-clean hinges addresses some of the more annoying problems with a simple design change.  The bolts and nuts are affixed to the toilet independent of the seat.  The top of the bolt creates a good seal that prevents leakage down onto the body of the bolt and the nut that holds it in place.  The seat then is placed on top of the bolt, pressed down, and locked with an easy twist of the hinge lid.  This makes the process of tightening the seat simple.  No more reaching around under the rim of the bowl, sticking your fingers in god-knows-what to tighten the nut.  It also makes removing the seat a breeze, so you can put it in the bathtub and scrub it down with your favorite cleaner (I favor bleach or Lysol) and let it dry while you scrub down the porcelain, removing every bit of organic matter that's found its way to area behind the seat.Personally, I prefer wooden seats because I find them more durable than plastic, and the Bemis is a good, solid wooden seat.  As far as anti-microbial action goes, I don't put much stock in things like that.  I prefer to trust to a good scrub brush and a bottle of my trusty cleaner.  I also appreciate the price of this model.  For all its advantages, it's a very modestly priced option.  You don't have to spend a lot of money for a good toilet seat.  Spend smart and you won't go wrong.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2009", "summary": "Just the best"}

I don't plan to use this everyday but just to have it there when I need it.  This is what I found so far.Pliers/wire cutter - I much prefer the pliers over the scissors as the main tool.  The pliers have teeth for grip but has a flat tip for fine plying.  Can be used in the place of the tweezers if you need stronger tweezing.  I also like the spring to keep the pliers open when not squeezing them.Bottle opener - Something that I always need but never have on me.  The opener also acts as an extension to the handle while using the pliers and gives a little more leverage.Flat blade - Rounded edge with a tanto like tip.  The tip is good as it is closer to the face of the blade lowering the chance that the blade will want to close on your fingers while cutting.  This is very important as it is not a locking blade.  It also comes decently sharp and under its own weight can just cut paper.Flat head driver - Pretty simple and does its job.  Can only handle little torque before starting to bend and damage the tool.Phillips driver/file - The phillips driver is decent and can only handle a small amount of torque, but as for the file, it is next to useless.  Its small and if anything it files in one direction; toward the tool.  Not a main function but don't even consider this as a part of the tool.Scissors - Cuts paper just fine.  I typically don't have much use for this but its a nice to have.Tweezers - This is a nice plus that I didn't realize at first.  They are a bit weak and not as grippy on things like splinters etc.  But since the pliers was designed well, you could use that for tougher jobs instead.Some other things I noticed - After just a day of this on my keychain, the black paint started to come off making it look worn.  I dont mind but just something to mention.  As some others have stated, when opening the pliers, the paint does come off and somewhat gouge the other half of the metal.  Also it comes with excess oil on all of the parts.  To me it is a good thing as it wont corrode before you get it.  You just need to wipe off the excess and you are good to go.  Lastly, the only time you have to open the tool is to use the pliers/wirecutters.  Everything else can be accessed with the tool in the closed position.I've had leatherman's in the past, and wanted to try something different.  I had not been let down (yet).  I would recommend this to keep with you at (mostly) all times.

One drawback, however, seems to be the following:We have the Nest upstairs, and another thermostat downstairs (two thermostats on one zone). If the downstairs thermostat turns the heat on (which is rare, since the downstairs thermostat is next to the heater), the Nest temporarily gives a wiring error code. Whenever the downstairs thermostat turns off, however, the error code goes away.I like the Android app. On our 4 hour drive home from a weekend away, I set the house from AWAY (50) to normal (68), and came home to an ALMOST warm home. After the house heated up to normal (68), it detected that nobody was home so it dropped the temp back to Auto Away (65). I probably should have guessed that, and next time I'll wait until we're closer to home before logging in to pre-heat the home.

Wound up getting this one to replace my older 13A Makita 7-1/4\" saw. The Makita had unstoppable power, but that is not what I need. I'm a woodworker, and I use this to break down sheet goods and cut hardwood to rough size. It is working pretty hard to rip 5/4 Ash, but it gets 'er done. For 3/4\" plywood, it is no effort at all.If you don't cut through materials thicker than 1-1/2\", this is a great saw. It weighs probably half of what my Makita did, and that was with the aluminum shoe. The steel shoe of this saw follows aluminum edge guides without binding. (aluminum to aluminum always binds up) The left blade design is great for righties.As for the blade selection, I admit that it isn't extensive. It is only really extensive for the 7-1/4\" saws. However, I have what I need. The included blade is not carbide tipped and is pretty much a throw-away. I bought the Skil brand carbide ripping blade. I also found a higher tooth count carbide tipped blade at a local tool store. The key to getting clean cuts in sheet goods with this (or any) circular saw is to make a zero clearance shoe that goes over the stock shoe.If you need to cut 4x4s, this isn't the saw for you. But if you need it to break down sheet goods and cut stuff up to 1-1/2\" thick, this one is really handy.

I have mine mounted to a Rockler acrylic base that I use with a saw guide.  I still use my normal 7 1/4 for 2 x4's and such, but this saw will handle 2x lumber pretty well too. The left side mounted blade is great to see what you're doing, and the light weight is wonderful.  The stock blade is pretty awful, and as others have commented it can be tough to find blades for this saw.  I found that using a Skill 4 3/8\" 40T flooring blade with 2 bushings works. The flooring blade has a 20 mm diameter cutout, and you can get bushings to go to 5/8\", and then 5/8 of an inch to half-inch is pretty common. You can get this blade at Home Depot and Lowe's. Oshlum (sold on Amazon) has a 24 tooth blade with the correct bushing for under $8, so it makes for a nice general-purpose blade. The smaller blade is nice for veneer plywood, but at 4 3/8 of an inch it won't cut full depth.  Doesn't matter to me as I only use it for plywood, and a lot cheaper than many 60 tooth blades for the 7 1/4 saw.  Just don't lose your bushings! They are gold when it comes to the saw.Just wanted to add, Amazon sells this 42 tooth blade as well: Tenryu SL-14042C that will fit with a 5/8\" to 1/2\" bushing.

I am not so much into fixing things because I like the work, it seems to be because I am fascinated by equipment and will learn a trade or skill just to use whatever new device holds my attention at the moment. And it comes in handy, especially in a case like the Bosch Fine Cut saw.. When I first saw one a few weeks ago my first thought was, \"How cool. But silly. A power handsaw. Is that not a great oxymoron? And what would you use that for?\"I liked the way the unit was reversible, the backbone of the saw action is integral to the blade and all the main unit does is provide power. The blade attaches and snaps over to either side in seconds. There are presently only 3 blades available, a coarse, a fine, and a true flush cut fine blade that will only run in one direction due to the offset. I would expect a carbide blade or an abrasive of some sort will be coming soon, as I have often needed a way to trim metal in a similar manner. But still I was unconvinced.About a week after that I got a project to remodel some cabinets in place and instantly discovered \"what for\". But I resisted at first, thinking I could pull it off with a Japanese backsaw and a recip, even though there would be some problems with scratching the cabinet interior. Before I could get started, I was called to replace a broken board in a redwood pool deck, a five foot section had snapped off of a 12-footer. It would have involved clearing away a railing and everything atop the good wood to remove the long piece and then trim it and replace. An hour, just for that.I picked up the saw immediately. ($99.00 at Lowes) along with 2 extra blades, as I have read they are somewhat delicate.It took longer to run extension cord to the job than to fix it. I marked the broken board to the length of the repair piece and put the Bosch to work. Two minutes, max, I had a perfect cut without a nick on the adjoining boards. One more job like this and the saw has paid for itself. It is hard to find that in a tool.(Added later) - Well, there was that job- replacing a water-damaged bottom panel under a kitchen sink. I probably wouldn't have even considered the job if not for this saw. A little hard to handle in close quarters, but I had the old panel out in about 20 minutes, with no damage to the cabinet. Like surgery.There may be other units out there that perform as well, I have seen cheap jamb saw for twice the price, and I have heard a plate joiner can be pressed into service for things like the deck.

The 3RILL uses a 1/4-inch quick-change hex chuck (as opposed to a traditional 3/8-inch 3-jaw chuck).Pros----- Quick and Easy Drill/Drive Bit ChangeThe quick-change hex chuck makes changing drill/drive bits quick and easy. Simply pull and hold the spring-loaded collet, drop in the bit, and let go of the collet to securely lock in the bit.- Compact and LightweightThe 3RILL is more compact and lightweight than most cordless drills/drivers. It measures only 7-3/4\" in length and 7-1/2\" in height.- Convenient and Intuitive ControlsThe controls are conveniently located to allow you to change the 3RILL to one of four modes (driver, drill (low speed), drill (high speed), or impact driver), set the direction of the rotation, or control the amount of torque.- Lifetime Battery ReplacementThe package comes with 2 rechargeable batteries. Rockwell's free battery replacement program will replace a faulty or worn out battery FOR AS LONG AS YOU OWN YOUR 3RILL. The CAVEAT is that you have to REGISTER YOUR 3RILL within 90 DAYS OF PURCHASE.- Long Lithium-Ion Battery LifeThe 3RILL uses lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries have the advantage of being able to retain their charge for MUCH longer periods than either NiCad (Nickel-Cadmium) or Ni-MH (Nickel-Metal Hydride) rechargeable batteries.Cons----- WobbleThe convenience of the 1/4-inch quick-change hex chuck comes at a price. The quick-change chuck is built to allow a certain amount of wiggle room to facilitate the ease with which bits can be inserted or removed. As a result, there will be a very slight wobble during drilling or driving. For high precision drilling, the wobble may present a problem.- Inadvertent Switch In The Rotational DirectionI frequently inadvertently change the direction of the rotation due to the placement/design of the directional switch.That's all the cons I have discovered so far after using the 3RILL for 3 weeks. For the most part, I love the 3RILL because it gets my simple home projects (such as hanging up wall shelves, installing curtain rails, removing fixtures, assembling furniture, etc.) done quickly and easily. Moving along...- ControlsThe controls on the Rockwell are intuitive and easy to use. The controls consist of(A) 4-Position Switch (on the top of the unit)This switch sets the unit into 1 of 4 modes: (i) screwdriver, (ii) slow drilling, (iii) fast drilling, and (iv) impact driver.(B) Dial (around the quick-change hex chuck)The dial has numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9... through 21 for adjusting the torque of the screw/bolt driver to one of twenty-two clutch settings. Beware you don't set the torque too high for the type of screw/bolt and material (be it hardwood, softwood, plywood, drywall, fiberglass, etc.) or you might strip the top of the screw head and/or damage the material.(C) 3-Position Switch (next to the trigger)This switch controls the direction of the screwing/drilling/impact driving: (i) counter-clockwise, (ii) locked, and (iii) clockwise.- Included AccessoriesIncluded in the package are 1 Flathead screw bit, 1 Philips screw bit, 2 drill bits, 2 battery packs, a battery charger, and a carrying bag.- Additional AccessoriesYou may want to consider getting 3 additional attachments to extend the usefulness of your Rockwell:(1) 1/4-inch Hex Quick Connect to a 3-jaw chuck adapterConsider getting an adapter for turning the 1/4-inch Hex Quick Connect to a traditional 3/8-inch 3-jaw chuck made byRockwell (RW9275)and other manufactures such asHitachi (725405)andMilwaukee (49-22-1560).(2) Magnetic Bit HolderFor an even faster change of your driver bits, get a Magnetic Bit Holder, such as theTEKTON 2901. Bits are secured in a magnetic hex sleeve.(3) Socket ExtensionFor attaching your sockets to the 3RILL, you will need a socket extension such as thisNeiko 3-Piece Chrome-Vanadium Extension Power Bar Set.---Despite a couple of problems, I really like the 3RILL. The most significant problem of the 3RILL is the wobble but I don't deem it fair to penalize a product because of a drawback intrinsic to quick connect hex chucks. Bottom line, for most home projects, the 3RILL will help you get the job done with incredible ease; for drilling that requires extreme precision, you might want to consider getting a driver with a traditional 3-jaw chuck.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2011", "summary": "Tackles Your Home Projects With Incredible Ease"}

By getting rid of the battery stem they gained freedom to design a more ergonomically shaped handle, which I really like.  They also lost compatibility with the older XRP pod type batteries, but I much prefer the newer form factor battery.  The slide in battery is much more compact and easier to install and remove.  This drill is lighter than the 18v XRP drill, mainly due to reduced battery weight.  You'll notice that on the job for sure, and it's a welcome change.  Overall the ergonomics are much improved.Longer Run Time:  The 3 Ah battery has 25% more capacity for longer run time between charges than the 2.4A batteries of the 18V XRP series.  And because they are lithium, they don't have the rapid self discharge of NiCd or NiMh batteries.  So you can not use the drill for a month, and it still has charge, but my older batteries would need a refresh.  Big improvements, to me.Some Cons:  These are really 18v batteries, not 20V -- says so on the box.  Dewalt says they call it 20V to avoid confusion with the older 18v XRP line.  I find it misleading.  I hate to quibble -- these are fine products, big improvements, but I have always trusted Dewalt to be trustworthy.  Makes me wonder....  Another claim is up to 1000 recharges.  I'll believe that when I see it.  I typically get 300-500 charges on a lithium battery before it dies, so 1000 is hard to believe, but let's hope.How you use them can affect battery life.  For best battery life, keep the battery cool, not in a hot truck cab if you can avoid it.  Lithium batteries degrade faster with heat.  Don't leave them sitting in the charger.  And never run it all the way down until the tool stalls.  For some reason, Lithium batteries don't like that.  I'm told there is a shut off in the battery when the battery is close to drained, a safety factor, but why push it?I'm not trying to start a debate here, but it's true that Makita (and Milwaukee, Bosch, Ryobi, Rigid) have had this same slide battery style for several years.  They are all popular for the reasons mentioned, and I'm glad Dewalt updated the battery to the slide format, finally.  I think competition is a good thing, it keeps them all making improvements and the customer wins.When I checked these out at the Big Box Store, I also looked at the baby brother of this drill, the DCD780, and I may get it too.  It's much lighter and smaller, and better for those quick jobs like screw driving, assembly/disassembly of things, whenever you just need a light drill without the heavy duty power of this one.  Its smaller battery is compatible with the charger and batteries of this one, a convenience.Seems to me there is a lot to like in these new Dewalt \"20 volt\" tools. The better ergonomics and longer run time are a big win.  If you like Dewalt, I think you'll especially like this new line.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2011", "summary": "Better ergonomics and longer battery life"}

I was looking for a compact and lightweight replacement and accepted the battery life and power tradeoff.After shopping around I found that the Makita and the Hitachi equivalent  to be the best balanced and most comfortable in my large and rather arthritic hands. The Makita was a better deal at the time and I've had good luck with most of my Makita tools in the past. Also, I wasn't too impressed with the crappy flashlight that came with the Hitachi kit. Had they included a decent LED light for the extra money, I might have gone with the Hitachi.I haven't used the drill a lot, but it seems as good as my old one. I've been using the driver pretty heavily driving 3 1/2\" deck screws and lots of 1 1/2\" metal roofing screws. The driver has been very comfortable and for such a small tool has had plenty of power for the job. It is easy to overdrive small screws, but not inevitable. The compact size and belt clip have been very handy up on the roof. I like the way the switches work on both tools - they feel better and are more easily accessible than many of the others I tried in the stores. I found the LED light more useful than I thought I would.The only moderate disappointment has been the battery life. Even though these are the compact batteries, I'd hoped to get a little more life out of them. Using the driver heavily I found I was swapping batteries pretty frequently. It's definitely a tradeoff, and I may eventually buy one of the larger batteries as a backup. That said, they really do charge in about 15 minutes and using a small and light tool is a benefit, especially in tight spaces and for driving lots of screws in a row.The soft case doesn't seem like it will hold up to much abuse, and if I were frequently moving the tools between job sites I would miss the form fitted blow molded case that came with my old Makita and held all the parts tightly.Overall, if the tools and batteries hold up over time, I'll be very happy with this set.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2013", "summary": "Pretty Happy So Far..."}

Like other LED bulbs, this bulb is rather heavy, so the note on the package suggests only using it in fixtures that can handle a heavy bulb. The bulb is shaped like a regular incandescent bulb, so it fits well in lamps with shades. Indeed, with the light on, it looks just like an incandescent bulb. However, it produces a lot less heat--you can easily hold on to this bulb while lit without burning your hands. That and the fact that it is plastic so it's not going to shatter if dropped or banged make this bulb a great choice for children's or infants' rooms. I've found CFL bulbs exceptionally prone to breaking, and they create a toxic mercury mess when they break. Even if they don't break, you can't just throw a CFL in the trash because of the mercury content, so you have to go to the trouble of returning it to the store or a hazardous waste collection site. This LED, on the other hand, is much less likely to break, and it contains no mercury. It will also last a lot longer than a CFL (and much, much longer) than an incandescent bulb.I find the soft light quality of this bulb very pleasing, and I also like the way it looks in my antique lamp.

Fine, sure, whatever. Amazingly, it actually works with my 25-year-old furnace. Who knew?But. One of the undocumented problems with the nest is that it becomes trivial for unresolved disagreements around what actually is a comfortable temperature to escalate into all-out war. First, only one account can control the nest. So, if you want to share access to the web/app interface you ideally need to share access to the email account affiliated with it*, and at the very least share a password on the nest site. Second, adjustments that used to require physical access can now be made even when one partner is 3000 miles away.It's bad enough when someone walks down the hall two minutes after you and fiddles with the thermostat. It's utterly rage-inducing when someone digitally walks down the hall and adjusts the temperature when they aren't even THERE.I turned the heat up. He turned the heat down. I named the thermostat, he named it something else. I turned the heat up again. He turned the heat down and changed the password on the nest account to an insult. I turned the heat up and banned the nest from the wireless network and changed the wifi router password.You can see the trajectory of the problem.So, before jumping to buy the latest tactile, shiny, overpriced, cloud-computing-based listening device for the NSA* that also happens to control your furnace-- you should ask yourself some questions:1. Do I and the people I live with have compatible temperature/environment preferences?2. Do we have good communication and conflict-resolution skills?3. Are we willing to share passwords?*4. When our temperature preferences diverge, is there a window of compromise?5. Can we agree to not make temperature changes remotely, overriding the preferences of the person actually in the home?The nest is $250. Couples counseling can be $250 an hour. You need to consider the strength of your relationship quite seriously before embarking on this journey to a more quantified life; there may in fact be no cost saving at all.That said, we eventually resolved most of our issues regarding the nest. And it's quite nice to return from a long trip and be able to turn the heat on before we disembark from the airplane, rather than walk into a freezing-cold house and wait, shivering, for the furnace to spring to life. But it was a little rocky getting there.There are other issues; the thermostat is in the hallway, which no one ever stands in unless they are coming or going. So I usually end up having to poke the thermostat to tell it *not* to auto-away. Also that hallway is quite protected from the bulk of the air volume of the home, so while it might be a quite comfortable 72, the bedroom might be a sweltering 77. etc. But hey, at least it's pretty.* Now with 100% more Google. Don't be evil! Seriously, though, password/app access may become even more of a problem if authentication on the nest site with a gmail or google apps account ends up being tied to your google account password. It is a Really Bad idea to share passwords for your email account. The interim step may be changing the email tied to the nest account to be a non-gmail email address (easy for me, not so easy for many people), but it will be very interesting to see how this plays out. The acquisition by Google means we will *not* be buying a Nest Protect, as we don't need to invest more money in a product line that may be developed in a way we are not comfortable with.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014", "summary": "couples counseling not included"}

First, it came with zero instructions, so it took me a few minutes to figure out how it works. \"How dumb are you?\" you're probably thinking. Well, the thing is, this lantern has no less than five \"bumps\" that look like they could be click-on switches. I tried each of them in turn, but only one actually turned the light on. Of the others, one was the hidden charging port, two were nothing but decoration, and one is supposed to allow you to adjust the handle into flashlight-mode.That's my second complaint. You're supposed to be able to push this button and angle the handle down, turning the lantern into a flashlight. Mine doesn't work very well. If I push VERY hard and pull on the handle with all my strength, I can get it to move down, but it's extremely difficult. Also, I think the handle was put on backwards, because the finger grips go the wrong way. If I hold it so it's comfortable, the flashlight shines right in my face!My third complaint is that my lantern arrived with a large crack in the clear plastic. It was packaged with lots of air-packs, so I don't know how the damage occurred, unless at the factory. It doesn't render the lantern unusable, but it is kind of annoying that a brand-new product would be broken upon arrival.So, what do I like about this lantern? It's nice that you can keep it plugged in and ready to go in an emergency. The only problem is, suppose your power stays out for a long time and the battery dies? You have no way of recharging it. It isn't like you can just pop a few new batteries in. I really like the plastic loop on top that lets you hang the lantern, so you can use it while camping. That's a plus in my book. In theory, the switch between lantern and flashlight is good, but like I said, the flashlight handle doesn't convert easily on mine, and the grip is backwards, so it fails in that regard. Another good point is that it's really bright.Two stars because it's an okay lantern, if hard to use. But if you really want the convertibility between lantern and flashlight, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.Edited to add (6/10/14): I took this lantern on a camping trip and used it to help me find the bathroom in the middle of the night. On my way back, I got hopelessly lost. Not an experience I would care to repeat, let me tell you! I was grateful to have the flashlight/lantern, but it wasn't enough to keep me on the correct path. I ended up having to completely retrace my steps back to the bathroom, and still managed to get lost AGAIN. The light just wasn't bright enough or wide enough of a beam for me to see the path I was supposed to take. So again, this lantern/flashlight fails. I wanted to like it, I truly did. But it did NOT live up to my expectations.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2014", "summary": "Okay Lantern, Poor Flashlight"}

There was nothing in the box to say how to use this item.  Fortunately, it isn't terribly hard, but some instructions would have been nice.  The first job was to figure out where the on/off switch was located.  It is not the knob on the top!  It is on the side.  Press once and either the lantern or the spotlight turn on.  Press again and it turns off.  Press a 3rd time and the other turns off, with a 4th press turning it off.  The next task was figuring out where to plug in the  charger.  Took me awhile, but I finally noticed that there was something just below the on/off switch that was covered.  I pulled the cover back and found the plug.I noticed there was a large button at the base of the handle, so I assumed it would allow the handle to be moved.  It did, eventually, but I found it very difficult to press the button all the way in while pulling the handle out.  It does allow the handle to be in the position for a spotlight if you want to use it that way.  I also noticed the top of the Flantern seemed odd.  After playing with it, I found you could pull it up to get a handle with a couple of hooks.  Guess this is if you want to hang it up.We have been having odd power outages lately, not to mention being in a hurricane area, so I will enjoy having a light to grab when the power goes out.

I purchased it to replace my 25-year old Porter-Cable 690...it had become deafeningly loud.  To make a long story short, I love this thing.  It's quiet.  The electronic speed control keeps the bit speed wherever I set it and the soft start keeps it from twisting in my hands when I turn it on.I've never had a problem with the collets releasing bits, either in operation or during bit changes.  The design of the collets is a bit funky.  After you loosen them, they easily unscrew, then get tight and then loosen again.  The bit is held tightly until it loosens the second time.  This is obviously by design and appears to be a safety feature to prevent improperly tightened collets from dropping bits when the router is turned on.Another safety feature (that I inadvertently tested) comes into play if you're using this router in a table and haven't locked it into the base.  When you turn on the router, the torque will unscrew it, except the design of the groves in the motor won't let it unscrew all the way and fall out...you actually have to lift it up slightly to get it to completely unscrew.  You won't notice this if you're using it in a standard base, with the motor facing up, but it prevented a nasty accident when I had it mounted in my router table.I'm your basic weekend woodworker, so I can't comment on reliability in commercial shop with heavy daily use, but it's perfect for my application.Strongly Recommended", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 12, 2013", "summary": "Quiet and powerful"}

I'm sure Home depot didn't under rate their flashlight by a factor of six or more. What I am sure of is that this Trustfire is way, way, over rated. Plus, by the time you buy this flashlight, the batteries, and the charger, you are out about $50. And, you better have an extra set of batteries in case you don't have your charger with you, or don't have time to charge them... Also, this flashlight has Off, Bright, Med., Dim, Flashing, and SOS. So, if you are clicking along and miss the setting you want, you have to click five more times. I was lured in by the 3800 lumens rating, and shame on the seller.I just purchased the other flashlight last week from Home Depot. It is their Defiant LED Flashlight that is rated at 650 lumens. It was a closeout, for about seven dollars, so you probably won't find it in the stores. This cheap Home Depot flashlight is much, much brighter than the Trustfire. Wow, it appears to be at least twice as bright as the Trustfire is. This would make the Trustfire,  as a very rough estimate, around 400 lumens. that would make the Trustfire 400/3800 =&#62; about 10% of what the seller is claiming. That my friends is just not good business.The Defiant Flashlight from Home Depot is marked on the packaging and on the flashlight with the number, 1000015067. It has  two settings, on and off, which I love. It comes with the set of three alkaline D cells that are needed. The batteries are not rechargeable.

It is lightweight, rugged and dependable.  About the only drawback I see is that it is not the easiest miter saw to align w.r.t. fence perpendicularity to blade. It can be done, but it may take awhile to align perfectly and it doesn't seem to hold alignment as well as it could, so I have to get our the squares to check alignment before attempting any finish work - work which I usually reserve for the table saw or Festool anyway, so this is not much of a problem for me - after all, this saw was intended for jobsite construction, not fine woodworking.  I should also mention that my model does not have soft start electronics.  The amperage spike when you start it is noticeable as is the considerable torque.)I have several Makita tools and they have all proven to be both reliable and durable.  I wouldn't recommend this for finish work (e.g.as a primary angle station in a framing shop) but for the price, it's a good value and sturdy and great for construction.I should also mention that the dust collector works quite well for an open miter saw.  I use a 1 1/4 hose and a shop vac, and this seems to get 85-90% of the dust, and the station itself stays remarkably clean from cut to cut.  only a light dust drifts  to the table top.I should mention that the replacement parts seem to be only available through online dealers that charge enormous shipping fees (though the parts are reasonably priced).  I've replaced some switches, brushes, cords, etc. over the years and invariably the shipping exceeded the cost of the part.  On the positive side, in my case the parts haven't failed that often.Simple Miter saw design, reliable, and competitive price.  Recommended.afterthought: I've come to rely on accurate laser guides on the modern tools.  My Makita L1040 has years of life left in it, but lacked a laser guide.  Oshlun makes a laser for this saw (Oshlun LG-M01 Miter and Portable Saw Laser guide - $22.49 @ Amazon) that works great on this saw.  See my review for details.

Well, I've been bugging to get this BK2 for months and finally pulled the trigger.  Let me just say that it's my new primary knife.Here's my comparison of the Gerber LMFII to the BK2 and why I prefer the Ka-Bar:- I like the pointed tip of the back of the handle on the Gerber LMFII, but the flat back of the handle on the BK2 is more practical as a tool.  The Gerber handle would be a sharper weapon and a better glass breaker, but the BK2 flat handle is better for hammering, which is what I would expect to use it more for- Blade thickness on both knives are right about the same, but I think I give a little bit of an advantage to the BK2.  The BK2's blade is larger from edge to spine than the LMFII though- The handles on the BK2 can be replaced.  This gives you options that the LMFII doesn't give you.  While I prefer the more hard rubber texture of the LMFII, I like the size and versatility of the BK2 more.  The diameter of the BK2 handle is a little larger than the LMFII as well, which I preferred more for my larger hands- The sheath on the BK2 is simple but sufficient.  The sheaths on both knives do the job - they hold the knife either upside down or on a belt.  Both have a pinch area on the sheath that holds the knife handle in so you can hang the sheath upside down from your gear, but I like the shape of the BK2's pinch area better.  My thumb naturally goes to the spot where you press against to get the knife to release.  The LMFII is a little more cumbersome to pull out because there's not really a thumb rest area to leverage against.  Also I actually broke one of the pinch tabs off of the sheath of one of my LMFII's which surprised me.  I was forcing it though, trying to &#34;reshape&#34; it so it would be tighter again after getting deformed from an aftermarket paracord wrap that I had put on the LMFII handle.  My own fault.  However, the LMFII sheath wins for functionality though because it does include a built-in knife sharpener that the BK2 doesn't have.I am convinced that a big thick survival knife is very necessary.  It could be your one and only tool to hammer, cut, pry, chop and slice with.  The BK2 and the LMF both have a great blade that has held up very well so I find both still very useful.  This BK2 just feels good in the hand, is very balanced, and the sheath is simple and does the job.  I have it hanging from the shoulder strap on my bail-out bag so it goes everywhere I need it to go.  I love this knife.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2012", "summary": "My new go-to survival knife"}

This little guy can be hidden in your hand, yet it can outperform the large flashlights with which we grew up. It is a single mode light; on, off, but no adjustable brightness. The flashlight is able to zoom its brightness. With the lens retracted against its body, it gives a large bright circle of light with no hotspot. With the lens extended, it concentrates its beam to the shape of the led. The light is much brighter when concentrated. This flashlight can run off a single AA battery or a single 14500 lithium ion battery. It is much brighter with 14500 battery. It has an effective belt clip screwed to its side; it can be removed. The construction of the light is very robust. On one of the sides, CREE is printed. On the opposite side, HausBell is written. It was received in a box with the name HausBell printed on it. No instructions were included or nessecary. Below is a list of other flashlights I own and how this flashlight compares.Mini Cree Q5 LED - sold by PoweraddDirect: This light is also $5.99. The Mini Cree Q5 lights up a larger circle of light (not by much) and is slightly less bright due to the beam not being as concentrated. The Mini Cree is a 3 mode light (high, low, and strobe). The lens zooms in and out as does the HausBell. You have the option of using 3 AAA batteries or a single 18650 lithium ion battery ( when used with the included extension).  If size is important, go with the HausBell. If you don't mind a larger flashlight, I would give a very slight edge to the mini Cree Q5. It has more features and a wider beam with little sacrifice to brightness.Lighting Ever adjustable focus - sold by Neon Mart: This light is very similar to the Mini Cree Q5. It is a single mode light with adjustable focus and it runs off 3 AAA batteries only. The beam is the same diameter as the Mini Cree Q5 and a hair less bright than the Mini Cree Q5 using the 18650 battery. Its beam's cutoff is sharper than the Hausbell and Mini Cree. It feels very well made; better than the HausBell and Mini Cree. If had to use a flashlight for work, this would be my choice. I would feel confident it would work every time and since it only uses AAA batteries, I could stock up on them for cheap and never have to worry. This is the light I'm buying my wife. Almost $10, but worth it. Although it gives up a tiny bit of brightness to the others, the build quality and the sharpness of its beam make it my choice for a compact flashlight.Intsun Ultrafire WF502B - sold by Intsun: Longer and skinnier than the above 3 flashlights. It is a 5 mode light (high, medium, low, strobe, and SOS) and has a fixed zoom. You have the choice of using 3 AAA batteries or a single 18650 lithium ion battery. This flashlight performs differently from the others. It is more of a spot beam with residual light that spills off the extremely bright small diameter beam. This light would work well for illuminating a specific area at a great distance. It is much brighter than the above flashlights. This would not be my choice for a light to use to walk the dog at night. It is a more specific use light. Excellent flashlight, but in a different category from the 3 above.Ultrafire Zoomable Cree XM-L T6 - sold by Intsun: Wow, what a flashlight! If you don't mind a bigger flashlight, this is the one to buy. It has the same 5 modes as the WF502B and zooms in and out like the HausBell, Mini Cree, and the Light Ever. You have multiple battery options: a single 26650 li-on, a single 18650 li-on, or 3 AAA batteries. It gives the largest diameter beam and is brighter than the others (except the WF502B, due to the smaller concentrated beam). It is very well made. It is priced around $10; a steal in my opinion.In summary, the HausBell 7W 300L Q5 led flashlight is a stellar performer. It combines size, performance, build quality, and price in one incredible package.I would like to comment about the advertised lumens of all these inexpensive, made in China, flashlights. They're exaggerated. In some cases, grossly exaggerated. Don't let that keep you from buying these great little lights. Their performance is comparable to flashlights priced many times their price.

At least until I received the Bosch DDH181-01 18V Brute Tough Drill Driver.The Bosch DDH181 drill driver, made in Malaysia or Mexico, comes with a battery fast charger, made in China, 2 18v high capacity lithium-ion batteries, a double-sided Philips drive bit, a removable handle, and a durable plastic carrying case.  The drill driver, weighing 4 lb 11 oz, features 25 + 1 clutch settings, a max 700 lb torque, and a durable ergonomic body.Compared to the DeWalt DC720KA, the Bosch DDH181 is about an inch taller and has a larger profile.  Even though the Bosch DDH181 is larger, it weighs 2 oz less and feels more balanced.  The Bosch DDH181 also has eight more adjustable clutch settings, greater torque, and longer lasting batteries.  Otherwise, both drill drivers offer similar features and kit pieces.One difference I noticed while using the two drills is how well the drilling area is lit.  The DeWalt DC720KA's LED light is placed above the power trigger where it casts a shadow from the barrel and chuck onto the drilling area.  The LED light is placed on the base of the Bosch DDH181, eliminating the shadow problem and fully illuminating the drilling area.  I could hold the Bosch DDH181 double handed without obstructing the light from the drilling area.  I could see where someone may need to fully grasp the handle with their pinky to prevent light blockage, as the angle is fine but the light is positioned about a half inch from the base of the handle.  I don't find this to be a problem though.As an active DYIer, the Bosch DDH181 is more powerful a drill than I need, as I've yet to hit the limits of the DeWalt DC720KA.  If I were buying a drill today, I would still purchase the more economical DeWalt DC720KA.  However, I prefer to use Bosch DDH181 due to its better weight balance and LED light placement.

I struggled with that thing because of its relatively low power and short battery life. I was a little wary of the '12-Volt Max' of these drills, but my dad (who has been using Li-Ion coredless tools for a while now) insisted that this new technology was far superior to the older NiCD models.He was right.The drill/driver are AMAZING. They are so much lighter and more compact than my old driver, yet far superior in terms of power, longevity, ease-of-use, and functionality. DEWALT makes great tools, and these little drivers are no exception.- Aesthetic / Ergonomics: standard Dewalt yellow-and-black. The drills are small, fit well in my larger hands as well as my girlfriend's smaller hands, and are light enough to use for extended periods without arm fatigue. I agree with other reviewers that the balance on these units is flawless.- Functionality / Power: these are tough little drivers! You wouldn't believe these are 12V drills, and wouldn't believe they were cordless, if you didn't know it to be so. They are workhorses and I can confirm they perform flawlessly drilling lumber, driving decking screws, putting in drywall anchors, even drilling concrete for putting up brackets/hooks in the garage. I really can't get over how powerful these units are, given their light weight and small size. As an added bonus, each driver has 3 LED lights built in which provide generous lighting of your work surface. They're bright enough for the drivers to double as flashlights in a pinch.- Lithium Ion Batteries / Charger: these batteries are great. One charge lasted me all day with light use; I ended up holding the trigger down and running the impact driver for several straight minutes the night after my first day of use, just to see how long the battery could last (a long time). Charging is a snap and batteries charge quickly enough that even under constant heavy use, you should always have plenty of juice ready to go.- Bag: the bag is OKAY, I guess... a bit of a disappointment when you look at the normal hard-sided plastic cases that normally come with quality power tools. The bag is fine, but not the same as a quality hardcase that protects tools from impact, water/sand, etc. I'm disappointed in the bag, but not enough to lower my review from 5 stars.BOTTOM LINE: these drivers are powerful little workhorses, yet small/light enough almost to be 'cute'. They fit my larger grip comfortably, but will work great for smaller users as well. These aren't going to be the main tool for professional carpenters, but for around-the-house use -- drywall, decking, cabinets, even drilling/mounting in concrete, these are great go-to tools.

Wood has an amazing ability to shrink when it is dry and expand (swell) when it is wet. I learned this hard way some 25 years ago when I built a nice rustic table from boards with unknown moisture content... and found a few weeks later that my nicely aligned boards shrank and formed unsightly 3/16\" gaps between them. Reportedly, 90% of hardwood floor installation problems are related to moisture content. Usually, moisture content is not something that one can see or feel without a tool, and any error can be quite costly. According to NWFA (National Wood Flooring Association), two conditions should be met. Moisture content of hardwood and subfloor should be within the typical range for the area where it is installed, usually in the range 6-8%, up to 8-13% in the coastal areas. The difference between the moisture content of the hardwood planks and subfloor should be within 4% for narrow planks and 2% for wide planks. If these conditions are not met, one may have to wait until the wood equilibrates with the environment.HOW THE MOISTURE CONTENT IS MEASURED. There are two ways to measure moisture content. The most common one is based on wood resistivity. measured between two pins pressed into the wood. Dry wood has much higher resistivity (typically in the range of hundreds of megaohms) than wet wood (in the range of kilohms).  The second method is contactless. The wood acts as a dielectric between two electrodes in the back of the gauge, thus forming a capacitor. A radio frequency current (in the range of hundreds of kHz) flows through this capacitor, and its capacitance (which depends on moisture level) is measured. The advantage of a contactless meter is that it does not leave pin marks on the wood and can go to a lower moisture content readings than resistance meters. However, it is more difficult to accurately measure capacitance than resistivity. Consequently, contactless meters are are less accurate at the low end but just as accurate or even more accurate than resistance meters at the high end (but their price at the high end is really high).WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHEAP AND THE EXPENSIVE. This is the usual  big question - should I buy a $30 moisture meter or a $300 one? What do I gain from buying the most expensive one, and what do I lose if I go with the cheap? My research on this topic revealed the following factors.1. All pin-based gauges use the same principle: they measure voltage applied to the pins and the current flowing between the pins to calculate resistivity. In order to do this calculation accurately, you need to accurately measure current and voltage. Additionally, due to high resistance of dry wood, it is really hard to measure at or below 6%. In the cheapest meters, you get the cheapest components (esp. low end analog to digital converters) and a poor measurement accuracy. Consider this fact: even the best tools just barely deliver the accuracy required to meet the NWFA requirements. According to the statistical study of P.J.Wilson published in Forest Products Journal in 1999, high end pin meters have accuracy (standard deviation) of 1.5% in the units of moisture content (compared to 2% to 4% range recommended by NWFA). I expect a lot higher errors with the low end tools, and some of them can be useless because they are so inaccurate.2. Moisture content may vary from the surface into the depth of the plank. For instance, a board which was rained on may be wet on the surface but dry in the center. Ideally, one has to get pin penetration depth of 1/4 to 1/5 of the thickness of the wood piece to get an average reading.  Low-end gauges may not have pins suitable for deep penetration, whereas high end gauges have stronger pins and pin holders and oftentimes come with external pin holders (probes) connected via a cable. Additionally, they frequently come with isolated pins in which only the tip of the pin is conductive; this helps to eliminate the effect of near-surface conductivity in the wood. This is critical in wood manufacturing. Fortunately, the difference between shallow and deep penetration readings are usually very small with typical hardwood projects, where wood is fairly dry. This mini Ligno comes with two sets of pins for two different depths, 5 mm and 10 mm, but they do not appear super strong.3. Moisture readings depend on the temperature of the wood. You typically get 0.5% difference for each 10F (5 degrees C) deviation from the standard room temperature. The most high end meters get built-in temperature sensor and do corrections automatically. Middle range tools come with a correction table. Low end tools may use a standard calibration for a typical room temperature of 70F and no correction option at all. This mini Ligno does not have a built-in correction but it has a correction table in the manual.4. Wood species dependence. Usually, moisture meters use Pacific NW Douglas Fir as a calibration reference, and apply correction coefficients for each specific type of wood (this has to be entered manually, there is no way for the tool to determine what wood it is measuring). While domestic species are relatively similar, exotic hardwoods may deviate from Douglas Fir quite substantially. The good news is that at moisture level below 10% (which is the typical range recommended for installation), the differences between most domestic species is within 1-2% moisture content which is about the same as error level of the meter itself. Therefore, these differences can oftentimes be neglected for the range between 6% and 10%.The higher end is the tool, the more sophisticated is the correction procedure. This low end mini Lingos like this one group all 54 wood species into two groups, with the assumption that variation within each group is small. Higher end tools may group wood types into 5-6 groups. Finally, one can have individual calibration for each specific wood type (up to 20-40 species). It does not really cost manufacturers that much to incorporate higher level of calibration details into the tool (in some cases, it is just the cost of the paper on which the conversion table is printed), but it results in a substantial price premium for the tools with many types of wood species listed individually. Of course, in order to take advantage of all this accuracy, you might also want to have deep penetrating (isolated) tips and built-in temperature correction and perhaps higher level electronic circuitry, and it all comes together as a unit in the $300+ price range. This advantage of high end models comes at a price of complexity which most people might not like: just imagine, you face a task of measuring moisture of walnut. OK, with an advanced tool, you may have a choice of African, American, European, New Guinea, and Queensland Walnut (go figure which one you got). Then, you need to measure at several different depths... Make sure temperature correction is done... Then, average multiple readings... Will an average user do this all? I suppose this is why not everyone needs (or will properly use) the most accurate tool.4. Ability to store and average readings. It is generally recommended to take multiple readings across different boxes of hardwood or different subfloor locations and average them. Higher end tools can do it for you. Not a big factor for DYI, but might be a nice thing to have for a pro.SUMMING IT UP: It appears that this model of Mini-Ligno falls into the low-mid range of moisture meters. It has adequate electronics to measure resistivity with acceptable accuracy for successful woodwork and hardwood flooring. It has a very basic correction for wood species (just two groups). It does not have a built-in temperature correction, but it comes with a correction table in the manual.  It does come with two sets of pins, but it requires some work to exchange them. My guess is that one can probably expect errors up to 2-4% of absolute moisture content (meaning you can likely may get a reading of 11% for the wood with moisture content of 8%). This gets one in a ballpark of marginally acceptable accuracy for determination if moisture content of the wood is in the NWFA range, and works reasonably well to check how well the moisture content of the hardwood and subfloor is matched.THE BOTTOM LINE: This is probably the cheapest mid-range gauge which you can buy to use as a reasonably accurate measurement tool for working with wood. Lignomat is considered a brand name in the world of moisture meters and has been in business since 1975. Mini-Ligno line is their pocket-size lower end line of meters, and this is one of the lowest end tools in the mini Ligno series. It appears to be just above the low-end boundary which separates tools from useless toys with pins, glowing numbers, and buttons. It is not quite as sophisticated, accurate, and robust to the daily abuse as higher end ($200 - $500) models from Delmhorst or Wagner, but it is about accurate enough for most common wood species for in-home hardwood installations and woodworking.  Very easy to use (just one button to press).  Very easy to carry around due to its small size.  Not a big financial loss if you break it or lose it. Relatively good price to value ratio for DYI people (although I am still puzzled what is in there that warrants the $100 price). You still get only (on a relative scale of moisture meters) as much as you paid for (and the readings can certainly be off by a couple percent or more for less standard wood species), but you might not even need anything more than this for the standard task of determining if the hardwood and subfloor are ready for installation. I've seen professionals using them, and they are certainly good enough for DYI folks.Higher end mini Ligno models with the letter C have a connector for external probe. For extra $10 or so, one can get an S/D model which can also measure moisture level in drywall (which might be useful for home inspectors inspecting flooded buildings).Almost twice more expensive DX model gets a lot more accurate with the built-in correction for 65 individual wood species grouped into 20 groups (and - I am guessing here - might also have more precise electronic components). This will get you an improvement by 1% or 2% in accuracy for dry wood and even more for wet wood.Wood groups listed in the manual of E/D and S/D include (there is no Group 1, just 2 and 3):Group 2: Abachi, Afrormosia, Bamboo, Beech, Cedar, Cumary, Cypress, Dogwood, Gonzales Alves, Ikoro, Jatoba, Koa, Locust, Oak, Poplar, Ramin, Rosewood, Teak, Wenge, Zebra Wood, Hardboard, OSB, waferboard.Group 3: Alder, Ash, Aspen, Balsa, Basswood, Birch, Cherry, Cottonwood, Cypress, Elm, Douglas Fir, Gum, Hemlock, Hickory, Kempas, Larch, Lauan, Mahogany, Maple, Meranti, Merbau, Myrtlewood, European Oak, Pine, Redwood, Spruce, Teak, Tigerwood, Walnut, and particleboard.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2013", "summary": "Gauge at the low end of high-end tools"}

It's 5 amp motor didn't even slow down during cutting. We are not chain sawing oak; we are only cutting a tiny slit on the side of wood. The fence detents of 0 and 45 degrees are accurate. More importantly it does not slip when cutting a biscuit. Dust collection appears to be one of the best. Even with the collection bag off of the unit, the shavings exited readily out of the chute, off to the side, and away from the operator.The only drawback is that in order to adjust the height of the cut, you must loosen the locking nut, and manually move the fence up or down. With this method it is possible to jump to a spot, which may be more or less than is needed. A micro fine adjusting knob would be nice. Some of the more expensive units have that feature. Freud chose to use a precisely fitting (no play) front \"sled\" with linear measurements inscribed on its face, and a locking lever that is very exact.On the other hand, the depth of cut is easily adjustable, and like the rest of the unit, very precise.If your the kind of person who coddles to the very best, and will be using it for your own projects, no matter how many you undertake, and are not dependent on biscuit cutting for a living, then this unit is for you. The only reservation is the height adjustment. Don't misunderstand me. You can get an exact height adjustment with this unit. A perfect setting as a matter of fact. You may spend an extra 20 seconds getting it there. If you cut a 100 different biscuits a day, that 20 seconds could add up.I am new to this machine and am convinced that with a little practice, I will be able to precisely adjust the height first time, by the way that I hold it, and visually measuring the difference using the measuring ruler on the fence face.All in all I give it 5 stars because of the quality of the tool, and the surprisingly low price.

I've had six incandescent Reveal flood lights in my kitchen for years, and replaced one of them with a CFL Reveal flood light last year.  After getting this bulb, I swapped out another incandescent bulb with this one.For starters, the incandescents, CFL, and this LED provide the same type of light.  With one CFL, one LED, and four incandescents, I can't tell a gradient in colors across the kitchen.  So, to me, this bulb follows in line with the characteristics of the past Reveal bulbs.  Yes, you can tell a difference when you look at the bulbs because the incandescent versions have a colored filter on the glass while the CFL and LED versions are white glass, but the light cast from them is nearly identical.The LED version takes a split second to turn on, so slower than incandescent but almost irrelevantly so, but it's at full brightness once it turns on.  The CFL version, on the other hand, takes a few seconds to reach full brightness.  I was really surprised by how bright this LED is.  I'd heard that LEDs were dimmer, but this one is very bright.  So, performance-wise, the LED is really nice.Cost-wise, that's where the LED still suffers.  The incandescent bulbs were about $7/each, the CFL that I bought was about $11-$12 dollars, and this bulb is currently over $40.  The CFL version is already pretty low in power and costs a lot less.  I understand that LEDs are supposed to last a very long time, but I just can't get past the cost of them.So, if the price doesn't put you off, these are great bulbs.

By touch, design, and appearance, it exudes quality. By function, it proves it. In fact I was so impressed I bought one for my brother and it quickly became a prized possession. What I like most is the sheer power of the beam and the optical quality of the focus. The intensity is stunning - in fact the low beam setting is necessary because the high beam can be too bright for some situations. The focusing design permits the light to illuminate with impressive uniformity, instead producing an uneven pattern of concentric rings like many incandescent focusing flashlights.Battery life has been fine for my needs and brightness is maintained during the period of use. Recharging is simple and relatively fast. Although many features have been programmed into the lamp, I find that high beam and low beam settings are the most useful. However, I must say that the strobe function is impressive because it could potentially blind and disorient a potentially threatening person (or animal).To illustrate the usefulness of a powerful beam, I was driving home from some distance away in the winter when the road was closed by the police due to weather. No alternative route was offered. So I called my brother and he used an online map to guide me home but I could never have seen the little street signs, house address numbers, etc. in the icy darkness of that storm without that light. It functioned just like a mounted spotlight.Although there are now less expensive imitations coming on the market, I elect to stick with the LED Lenser line because every one I own has proven to be a winner (I have four different models).

I am a careful and methodical person, so I really studied the case, and found there is simply no way to gracefully open it. You have to force it open. When you force it open, all the little bits jump out. Then of course, you do not know which bit is which, because they have been scattered all over your table and floor. If you are lucky enough to find them all after this, then you are faced with the task of sorting them and figuring out which one is which size. Good luck with that unless you have a good micron caliper.Well, I did get them sorted, and back in the case, and my next task was to actually use one of the smaller bits.

The D handle is nice too I use that the most.  I have had some trouble with the bit coming lose on the 1/4\" shank but only because I did not tighten it good from the excitement of having a new tool (no harm done).3.)It does have variable speed which I love to control on various hardwoods.4.)The other feature I like are the cord connectors which have their own plugs and are easy to connect. The ends of the cord twist and latch so you know they're in place.5.)The plunge base has a vaccum port on one of the shafts that I have yet to use.6.)The dial on the router bases are smooth and raises and lowers the motor with precision and locks tight.The cons:1. When routing some stock you can really see the coils and bushings wind up the eletricity through the top vents which is normal but can be distracting, I'll get use to it2.I like the one wrench bit removal with the push pin to hold the collet in place, but it takes some practice. (No more loose bits!)Overall the machine is excellent and I am happy with the purchase and performance.  The cons are very minor.

This is one of those products that home decorators (and perfectionist home owners) will appreciate. The ability to change the colors of switches and outlets to match or complement the color of the wall, or even accentuate the furniture. With twenty colors to choose from, and a matte finish to boot, we can finally say goodbye to the gauche effect of the ubiquitous shiny white and \"ivory\" plastic wall fixtures contractors tend to favor. In addition, these switches and outlets are amazingly easy to install and change. The only drawback for most home owners is that the unit cost is high compared to conventional fixtures. However, if you own a home to which you would like to add subtle improvements and value, this might be a wise investment.The only real downside to this product is that incandescent light will be phased out over the coming years in favor of compact fluorescent lighting.

Did not deduct any stars for this issue.Update:After using the saw for a few months now; the dust collection is just as good as advertized.  I needed to cut inside the house and put two shop vacs on it.  One on the discharge port (as is normal) and the other beside the blade to catch the side discharges.  Result was almost no dust in the air.  Still had a bit of dust dropping straight down to the floor which was a simple cleanup.  Very happy with it.Also had my very first experience with a defective blade.  The blades shadow was much more narrow than the actual cut.  Changed the blade out and the laser guide is now perfect.  Found that my first blade had some bent teeth right out of the box - this caused the cut to be much more wide than the shadow of the blade.

Here's my take on it.The Dewalt 12\" Sliding Compound Miter Saw (DWS780), has been designed to be precise and accurate enough for fine woodworking, yet durable enough for framing and deck building. It's ideal for a variety of end users including cabinetmakers, trim carpenters, framers, installers and many other professional contractors who require a product that delivers the accuracy, capacity, durability, portability and ease-of-use that this saw offers. This is the description provided, but what follows is my review based on actual use and performance.The Dewalt DWS780 replaces a Ryobi 10-inch compound miter saw that I had used for 3 years and it is without a doubt the best saw I have ever owned. The power, smoothness, preciseness and versatility make this saw a winner. In addition to being comfortable to use, it is very quiet. After owning this Dewalt, I wish that I had upgraded to a 12-inch saw a long time ago. It is great being able to cut large posts without having to flip them over to finish the cut on the other side of the work. The other really outstanding feature of this saw is the sliding action which enables the user to cut wide, flat boards in a single, fluid motion. Without the sliding action, the user must flip over the work and attempt to line up the saw to finish the cut. Adjustments are easy and smooth, and the preset angles are precise. In short, the Dewalt DWS780 is a topnotch saw for professionals and homeowners alike.Useful Specifications:1 - An XPS LED light and cut alignment system that casts a laser-like shadow on the work surface showing users where the blade will come in contact with the material. Unlike lasers, the XPS LED does not require calibration.2 - The dual bevel system allows the ability to bevel right and left from 0 to 40 degrees with positive stops at 0, 22.5, 33.9, 45 and 49 degrees in both directions.3 - Miters 60 degrees to the right and 50 degrees to the left and features an adjustable stainless steel miter detent plate with 10 positive stops.4 -  A cam lock miter button allows users to lock angles between detents for jobsite versatility5 - 15 AMP motor delivers 3800 RPM for extended power and durability.6 - Industry-leading variety of cut capacities include  6-3/4 inch vertical, 7-1/2 inch nested crown, 13-7/8 inch horizontal and exclusive back fence design that cuts up to a 2x16 dimensional lumber at 90 degrees  and 2x12 at 45 degrees. The unit also includes a rail lock latch for holding the head away from the fence.7 - Highly efficient dust collection system captures over 75-percent of dust generated.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2011", "summary": "Top-notch Saw for Professionals and Homeowners Alike"}

It only heats up 1/3 gallon at a time so it isn't wasting a lot of electricity trying to keep a large amount of hot water heated. It heats up water fast enough that if you just wait about a minute or so you'll have more hot water if you actually need more than what is provided.Like others have said, it does tend to spit out hot water at a certain temperature point and you have to be careful or it will spray and burn your hands. I have never had any issues with the faucet handle or the thermostat and heating element, but the tank is a different story. I think the longevity that most users experience of only a few years is due to the fact that it is a copper tank unlike more expensive units that have a stainless steel one. Also, if you have really hard water the mineral deposits will build up quickly in the tank and it will start to pop loudly when heating and will shorten the lifespan of the unit. I have a water softener which I'm sure helps. After about 6 or 7 years, mine started leaking very slowly from a small hole that developed in the tank. Luckily, because it is copper, I just disassembled the unit and soldered the hole shut easily. In the process, I broke up all the deposits that had built up inside and got most of that out as well. It is now running like new again. If it wasn't for the fact that it was easily repairable by someone who is a little handy, I would have given the unit 2 stars instead of 3.The bottom line is that it is a lower-end copper tank and the lifespan will never be that of a $200+ unit with a stainless tank.

The moon-shaped lights I have are pre-LED and went through batteries like a weepy movie goes through popcorn. I went to their alternate plug-in capability. That limits placement. Also they're for interior use only, larger than I'd prefer and, anyway, no longer available (duh). And a room previously night-lighted by a vintage bar-clock needed illumination when the weird fluorescent lights in the clock expired. And outside rather than keep dusk-to-dawn rope light outlining exterior walkways I'd try the motion methods for the exterior as well. Let the search begin. I tried lights that were about palm-sized, square, that bristled with LEDs like a mutant creature from Edison's studio. I would have tolerated their nervousness -- on before serious darkness, off at uncertain intervals --  but they were battery abusers. Costly.  Then I read the report by the impassioned seeker of The Right Light (see above somewhere) and bought several on her say-so.They arrived in short order and were nicely packaged, well-designed, well-made and simple enough that the instructions were not required though welcome. And thorough, even suggesting how to use the back cover as a template if you chose to use the included screws to mount the light. All in all a much more complete product than many off-shore items in my experience. The individual light is  more or less square and not much larger than the three C cells you'll need (not included) to make it work. An indentation on the face provides a lip to aim the light downward and keep it out of your eyes if you use these for stairs.Use a coin to remove the back (inside you'll find the mounting screws and a band-aid-sized swatch of two-sided mounting tape.) Before you hasten to pop in the batteries you have two decisions to make - how long do you want the light to stay on? Find the lever to select either 20 seconds or 60 seconds in the belly of the light, a place that would be hidden if you put the batteries in first. Another switch there will select to have a soft glow from the light all the time (in darkness) or only the brighter light when triggered by motion. I chose one of each in the room where the clock had once been my light to see which I liked best. Soft glow it is...The exterior light I put just outside the sliding glass door where I go from the house interior to a patio. I screwed the light into a wooden wall - not all that easy actually because the provided screws are skinny little imps and the screwdriver that fit was so small it was hard to turn. Ok find the drill and make some pilot holes -- Piece-a cake...  Couldn't wait until darkness climbed out of the trees. Slide open the  door and instantly a square yard of light welcomed my foot. Like a knight throws his cloak over muddy water. I placed a now queenly sneaker on it and smiled. I feared the light might be that too-cool LED blue but it was a neutral just-warm light.The reason I deducted one star: the two-sided mounting tape, though as strong as that stuff usually is, could hold the three-battery weight for maybe 15 or 20 minutes. A where-where search turned up an out-of-the-way perch on the desk for each of the two lights I used here. Designed to stand on end like a travel alarm clock the lights were kept in place with the stickum tape, at last a task it was up to. The desk height, by the way, proved to be a bonus. The entire floor is washed with light as I walk by. The motion detector is very quick to catch an  approach and covers I'd say a full 180 degrees.I can tell you that the lights stay on quite accurately to the selected time and only if it is dark enough to need them. And that the brightness and color suit me fine. What I cannot tell you is how much choosing the all-night glow shortens battery life (but I love that glow)or how long the batteries will last. So far the outside light has already outlasted the square one that bristled with LEDs. All is well in the motion light world. Just don't plan on the sticky stuff to do more than auxiliary work.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2012", "summary": "En-LIGHT-enment at last..."}

The compressor fills up very quickly (~30 seconds at start-up for me), so draining after each use is not a hassle. The finishing and brad nailers have both been reliable for me so far. Through a couple thousand finishing nails, I've had no jams and the only misfires were due to user error. I haven't used the stapler, yet.I was also able to use the compressor with a rented flooring stapler without trouble. I was not moving particularly quickly, but 300 sf in 8 hours went smoothly. As with the included nailers, the only misfires were due to errors on my part. The compressor motor was not running constantly either, so I didn't have to wear ear protection the whole day.While I have nothing bad to say about the kit, don't interpret my review to mean that you should expect 30-gallon, 200 PSI performance from this 6-gallon, 150 PSI machine. Basically, this combo kit is perfect for my home usage, none of which challenges the specifications of the compressor or nailers. However, I could see where a higher work rate or more challenging application would yield a less satisfying experience. Professionals planning to run multiple hoses from a single compressor might want to consider a set-up with a larger, more powerful compressor. Folks looking to use air tools for mechanical applications would likely be more satisfied with a more industrial compressor as well.Update (8/29/2013):Since posting my initial review, I've been running the compressor pretty regularly with a Primatech P240 flooring nailer, as well as a small paint sprayer. The higher rate flooring nailer runs beautifully off the compressor. The paint sprayer works alright, but the compressor motor runs frequently enough that I started wear hearing protection while using it. No surprise there; for me, the convenience of the small, easily portable compressor tank still outweighs the inconvenience of remembering to put on some noise-cancelling headphones before using my sprayer.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2013", "summary": "Excellent, easy to use compressor/nailer combo kit"}

At that lowest setting (assuming I didn't bump the knob with the back of my hand) it heated the fittings very evenly and slow enough to where I could sweat them and wipe them clean for a reasonable looking finish.  I gave it four starts since it is a handheld blast furnace, but for larger pipes (most likely it's intended use) I assume it would work do beautifully for you!

So it is pretty much a run in the park and only during the reaches do I get a sense of my progress: not sufficient.  So I was super excited whe this watch arrived overnight (bought it from HRM USA, highly recommend).  Set up was very easy and please know that you need to be in open space for the watch to pick up satellite signal to set the time.  Okay, the experience when I went on my run: hit the 'page/menu' button a minute before my run started to allow the satellite pick up my location and then hit the 'start/stop' button which will immediately record your training. Remember to hit the 'lap/reset' to save your race.  I really enjoyed the pace monitor as it really helped me to see my own performance that day.  I do a lot of training in the gym too, and i bought the pod to allow me record my runs: very easy to use, once you hit the 'page/menu' button, the watch will detect the foot pod and use the right set of two buttons to scroll up/ down to confirm thatnyou want to use the food pod.

It is perfect for my pocket, shaving kit, backpack, flight carry-on bag or etc.This may sound odd, but as a flashlight \"geek\", I have been waiting for this LED light to come out ever since Maglite announced it. I have looked intently for a comparable pocket LED flashlight, and to be honest I have had no luck at an affordable price. This flashlight seems a great blend of features and price.I wanted a flashlight that had the following features, this light does them all well.1) LED (currently the brightest and longest lasting technology for a small size)2) Bright (the Maglite Solitaire LED is 37 lumens compared to 2 lumens for the conventional Maglite Solitaire incandescent bulb)3) Small size (takes up minimal room in pocket)4) Runs on a single AAA, for inexpensive and easy to find battery5) Twist on/off, this is so it is not turned on accidently in a pocket like a push button6) Rugged construction7) Has a lanyard hole, for keychain, etc.8) Easy to find, i.e. not a custom product or special factory run9) Fairly inexpensive. Some competing pocket lights fit the bill above, but came in at $35 to $60 or more! Yikes!This Maglite Solitaire LED AAA fit my wish list perfectly. There are many, many small lights out there. Some are excellent in different ways, but looking through my feature wish list, all that I looked at came up short in some way.One note: A company named Fenix makes an LED model E01 that was the best affordable runner up to this Maglite LED Solitaire. However, it is not nearly as bright at 10 lumens (compared to Maglite's 37 lumens).Regarding brightness, according to Maglite this light has a 37 lumen LED. That is more than twice as bright as a larger incandescent flashlight by Maglite. The commonly found 2 AA Maglite regular INCANDESCENT flashlight is 14 lumens according to Maglite.For size comparison, this light is the same size and weight of the \"old\" traditional Maglite Solitaire AAA light.Added pros of this Maglite LED Solitaire:1) It can be used in candle mode. That is, aim up and rest on tail cap to illuminate a room. While this light isn't going to give you reading light, it will allow you to see the furniture or etc.2) Made in the USA (according to the Maglite website).3) This light has a lens instead of just the bare LED like some other pocket flashlights I've seen.  This is nice for a pocket/bag as it protects the light from getting a lot of lint and obscuring the light.4) The light goes on when the head is twisted just shy of half way (maybe 45%).  This seems a nice balance between too little (could turn on in pocket accidentally) and too much (could prove tedious).Minor con:The light rolls easily when on a flat surface like a nightstand or table. But this is easily and cheaply fixed by attaching a key ring or similar clip to the lanyard hole. It doesn't even need keys on it, virtually any ring will do. A ring came in the Maglite package I got this in.UPDATE:I tested how long a \"normal\" off-the-shelf alkaline AAA battery would last in this flashlight.  After an hour it dimmed ever so slightly and the flashlight itself got very slightly warm, but both were hardly noticeable.  Then at 2:16 hours (aka 136 minutes), the light quit abruptly, and the flashlight did not give any more light.  These \"new\" LED flashlights regulate the power so you get the max light for the max time out of the battery, but then when it gets below a certain level, it can't give you any light at all.  Immediately after the light quit, I pulled the battery and it measured 0.9 volts (a new one is approx 1.6 volts).  So it will do well on diminished batteries (in a pinch), but very dead batteries will give you nothing; not even a slight glow.Bottom line, this is a great small flashlight. For slightly larger flashlights, see these other two I like below.

I'm not a master knife sharpener by any means and it will take me at least a couple months to get it right... so instead I've looked around for a knife sharpener that I can use to be a quick fix on my junk knives. Seeing how this is much cheaper than other knife sharpeners, I decided to buy one from Amazon. The positive reviews definitely help!I'm giving this item a 4-star review because it does work, but there's no way that it can ever make your knife as sharp as it was from the original factory edge.What impressed me though is how it can take any knife, no matter how bad of a condition, and get it back to a decently sharp edge. I had a couple kitchen chef's knives (stamped, low quality) that were marred beyond belief like a butterknife and doing the paper slice test actually ends up bending the paper before any cut is made.The directions say 4-5 passes but I actually had to do about 9-10 passes on my knives before it would get back to some kind of sharpness.  Although it's not razor sharp, I have salvaged probably about 8 or 9 knives now with this thing.I'm not sure how long the blades last, but I do know that they are reversible. Other reviews say that after about 40 or so passes, you need to swap the blades. The replacement blades, also by AccuSharp and sold by Amazon are about $2 cheaper than the actual unit itself.I do like this unit, but I'm not sure if I trust it enough to use on my more expensive knives (like the Wusthofs). But for any other blade in the house, I do fully trust this product and can recommend it simply because it's so cheap and can salvage any blade to a useable degree.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 1, 2011", "summary": "Decent Sharpener, Replaceable Blades - Cost Effective"}

They either go totally dark in much less than half the rated time, or have gone too dim to even read large print with the light pressed closely to the page. To even get close to half the rated life, skip the alkalines, you must use expensive lithium or the highest capacity NiMi rechargables available on the planet.So they all lie about or misrepresent your actual battery life. I'm sure some of them, if you put the most expensive batteries in the world in them, run the light almost to their rated battery life, if you take them into a fully darkend room, & hold the light to your face, strain your eyes, you will find the LEDs are still glowing very faintly... but that's not useful light.I haven't found AAAA rechargables or lithiums, but you won't need them.This is the only LED light I ever found that doesn't give you bull on battery life. It uses a single LED & 3 AAAA alkaline batteries that can be obtained cheap from many sources. Slightly longer than an oridinary pen, I take it everywhere, & is always with me at work. As an engineer, I've used it several times daily for over 6 months with the original batteries. I thought it might be getting a little dimmer so recently put fresh batteries in it. Although it got brighter, not significantly, so I put the old batteries back in. This light just won't die. Lot's brighter than any keychain light, it's as useful as most big lights. It fell 14' from a ladder onto solid concrete, into puddles, snow, & got paint & glue on it. Using harsh chemicals & scraping to get all the paint & glue off, it still looks & works like brand new. I don't know what they used to paint that light with, but there's not a scatch on it anywhere... no dents yet either. Solid & durable. Your best light will be the one that works when you need it to, & is close at hand. Best $14 I ever spent!Update: AAAA Batteries can be found right here at amazon. Just type AAAA or streamlight in the search box. The streamlight AAAA 6-pack runs $6-$7 & are really alkaline energizers. Also if you tear off the metal around a \"copper top\" alkaline 9 volt battery with a couple of pliers you'll find 6 aaaa batteries inside. But beware... the AAAAs inside the 9 volt battery have the polarity reversed! So you must put those in your light BACKWARDS. You should also stretch the light's spring out a little for a tight fit & better contact. This won't effect it if you go back to ordinary batteries, just make sure to get the polarity right.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2005", "summary": "Best $14 I ever spent!"}

I've seen the same box at my local home center in worse condition (for $50 more too). The box was sturdy and everything was well packed with no missing parts.Setup -Manual was very clear except for the fact that I've got a different regulator on mine than was pictured or explained. No biggie, and as mentioned above, everything is in the box. Just put it together and go. Well, don't go right away - be sure to follow the instructions for breaking in the tank and motor - very important! Run it for 15 mins with everything wide open.Use -I shot three rooms worth of crown with the finish nailer using 2 different sized nails with only a single misfire (which was entirely my fault, I was at a bad angle and laid on the trigger too long). I used both the Porter-Cable nails as well as Paslode's. The Paslodes work great and are slightly cheaper than the PC's at my local home center. The finish nailer itself feels lightweight, but surprisingly rugged. I got more tired moving the hose around than I did hefting the gun over my head. Very comfortable to use.I must admit that the brad nailer hasn't even left the case yet, but if it performs anything like the finish nailer I will be very pleased.The compressor is LOUD but I've never used a compressor that wasn't... What I like though is that it comes up to pressure quickly and recovers pressure during use just as fast. This means that if you're only running a single nailer from the compressor it will most likely be off more than running. It doesn't struggle to keep up with you at all.Conclusion -With nothing really negative to say about the product, the value of the total package, and the fact that everything is included in the box, this one is a clear buy.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2004", "summary": "Excellent Value"}

I can manually turn on the shower exhaust fan, then when the unit senses that the humidity is low enough, it turns off the fan automatically.  I thought the sensor worked well for sensing humidity and turning off accordingly.  Mine is mounted about 6 feet from the shower & works well in the auto on/off mode or manual on/auto off.The installation instructions are clear and concise.  Also, several adjustments can be made:-Humidity level for turning on/off the fan-Time (minimum time that the fan will remain on after turned on by any method)-Sensitivity (low, medium, high)-Air Cycle Mode which can have the fan turn on/off for a set period of time.  This is a nice feature for tight houses that don't have an air exchanger & need stale air ventilation.One thing I didn't think of before I got this controller, was this unit works great for controlling  shower/bathing humidity.

I don't know if I will ever need it, but there is a feeling of security just knowing it's there. I don't camp and I don't go places that are dangerous, but you never know. And I have a lousy sense of direction. Once while heading for a shoe sale I ended up in some quarry where there were big red signs about dynamiting and a lot of angry men in hard hats came running at me.The Friendly Swede Carabiner has a 3 inch bundle wrapped in braided paracord. The whole package is small and virtually weightless, but there is a bunch of good stuff inside.  I know because I went an unraveled the darn thing.  You should trust the Friendly Swede. Once you unwrap that paracord, you can't rebraid it. I keep mine in a tiny leather pouch now...not much bigger, but not nearly as cool.What you get for your $15 is a lot. Starting that paracord ...nine feet of it and potentially very helpful if you remember what Bear Grylis taught us about building a shelter out of sticks and  leaves, bundling our belongings, or finding dry wood and making little floats that help us when crossing a stream or lake, that sort of thing. However It  doesn&#8217;t look terribly strong and I would not use drag myself up or down a mountain or anything like that. And given my fear of heights, if there are mountains in front of me, I&#8217;m staying put anyway.The &#8216;grenade&#8217; also contains two separate fishing lines with hooks, sinkers and bobs for each.  Not fancy, but I don&#8217;t think a fish would care&#8230;although those of us who do go fishing know that those little rascals can make themselves scare when we really want them.  You get a nice hunk of tin foil, which can be used as a heat reflector, to wrap your leftover fish, turn into a solar still (Bear Grylis explained it all&#8230;not much water, but better than none...and if you didn&#8217;t watch him or Les Stroud or the rather sexy Mike Hawk and wife, you should rent the tapes or stay indoors.The kit also contains an alcohol swab for cleansing stuff like wounds and a needle for those who don&#8217;t have the foresight to have a sewing kit. The instructions say this can be used for suturing wounds, but if we are camping and you have foolishly torn yourself open and expect me to sew you back together, it's not gonna work.  I&#8217;d pretend I was looking for water and just leave you.  And there's a chance I would have sucked the alcohol out of the pad when I discovered we were lost.  On the other hand, I would not go all Donner Party on you either so look at the bright side.There is quite a bit of wire included as well&#8230;for making snares to trap small animals.  I don&#8217;t know if I could make a snare that would fool even that one rabbit that the other rabbits point at, but at least it&#8217;s there.  Most important is the fire starter. Yes, you can actually make sparks with it. They even provide some tinder. Les Stroud made it very clear that the stick rubbing thing ain't gonna happen, so this is crucial. Fire keeps away big animals, makes you easier to spot, and keeps you warm.  I never remember to include matches in my first aid kit, so this is a very good thing. You also get a tiny but very sharp knife...enough for cooking purposes, I suppose, and cleaning the fish, that sort of thing. And another thing my survival materials did not have.All in all, the kit seems well thought out. I'd give one to those outdoorsy types who like to camp, or to anyone who lives or travels through underdeveloped areas.  For me, the &#34;grenade&#34; is going to sit in my glove compartment, forgotten, along with the reminder about my 2014 car registration (It's a smog year...who can bother?).  But if I ever find myself down at the Silver Queen Quarry instead of the Glendale Mall again, I'll feel a little bit better.  Although I have not tried the product, it certainly looks practical and provides the essentials.

I noticed immdiately that the weight was reduced to 85 pounds.  I consider this to be an improvement because its previous weight of 104 pounds is a burden if you intend to move it around your small shop.  85 pounds I think is the appropriate weight for  this tool and it still feels rock steady.  Also, I was happy to see that this model is now has a smooth finish which added good looks on it.  I was blessed enough to get it on sale for $199 plus tax (regular price is $249.99).  To add to that, Sears accepted as a payment an unused tool worth $100 that I returned to them I already written off as wasted.  Assembly was a snap.  The fence perfectly sits 90 degrees from the table.  The motor feels it has enough power to handle any hardwood available but it is really noisy.  You will need earmuff to protect your ears to add weight on the goggles you are already wearing.  It is even noisier when you run a wood on it.  One drawback of this tool is that it has short infeed/outfeed table.  You will need a roller stand with the same height as the outfeed table to recieve long boards you intend to plane.Overall assessment, this tool will perform its purpose and is perfect for woodworkers with small space.  Knowing how to use this tool properly will duplicate the work of bigger jointers.  You will just need practice and a little bit of patience to accomplish the job.

That makes this tool a little shorter and similarly useful.  As a stand-alone tool, I prefer the PS32 because I generally don't like drilling with quick change drill bits, as they are more expensive and less common.  That makes this tool most useful for driving, but if you're looking for a tool just for driving, then I recommend the PS40/41/(42 to be released?) impact driver, which brings more power to the table (the only downside to the impact driver is that you should not drill with it).My M.O. is to double-fist it with the drill/impact diver; the two of them can handle almost anything except heavy masonry work, in which case I break out the corded Bosch hammer drill.That makes this tool's perfect niche as the extra driver hidden away on each floor close at reach for small tasks that come up.  It can handle large tasks just like the PS32, but if the task is large, you may have to run to the tool storage area for some other tools anyway.The new 2 amp-hour batteries bring &#62;50% more life to the tool between charging (he 1.3amp-hour batteries always seemed adequate; in the above scenario, I'd use my PS20 on occasion, and charge just once a year or so) while only being 1-2mm longer.  The LED light now stays on for a few seconds after drilling, the battery gauge is new compared to the PS20, and the included, optional belt clip and bit holders are much appreciated new features.This tool has improved in every way over the PS20, and I love it.

The battery on the bottom balances the weight of the drill so it does not feel top heavy.Our current project is repairing and adding on to our backyard deck.

There is a battery level indicator on the battery so you know when it is running low.While we are mainly using this drill for household projects, it has the features and versatility a professional would want: Brushless motor, advanced electronics, dura shield housing designed to withstand 10 ft. drops, LED light to illuminate the work space, belt clip and bit holder, and the drill comes with L-BOXX-2 carrying case with a tool insert tray.

It took some pushing down adjusting and replacing cable ties but got them to stay somewhat secure. The little cable tie against the overflow tube is a poor design.I Did a test for 6 months and there were no savings.  First the low flush: I found that the low flush is adjustable and seems to save water. The problem is that the water you think you save in the flushing is being wasted in the fill of the toilet bowl. There is no adjustment as to how much water goes into the bowl which causes excess water to continue to flow until the tank is full.Second The full flush: Here there is very little adjustment and waists more water than the regular flapper since I can not adjust more than the little bit that the unit allows.  This one is big time waster because it uses the entire water in the tank to flush. My old flapper was better!Controls:  The push button works. Definitely not like pushing a button on a radio. You have to push with some force. Especially the low flush since the button is smaller than the full flush.  My kids used it and had no problems, but had to tell them to use their thumb to push the button in.  I don't like how the buttons operate because using it like this puts unnecessary pressure in the bolts holding the tank to the toilet.Reliability: I bought 3 units. One unit in the master bathroom would leak and needed constant monitoring and adjusting.  A second unit was in the half bath and was the most used. It seemed like it worked. A third unit was in the kids bathroom and seemed to work, but I heard it leaking a few times also, but eventually got it to work.Update:Removed all 3 units. I could not trust them. Too much tinkering to get it to work. Water can destroy your walls if your toilet overflows.  I purchased one of the Fluidmaster S2DBL units (expensive in comparison). This one was more work to install. The tank needs to come out and replace the center overflow tube assembly.  I didn't replace the fill valve since mine was fine. I had to cut 1\" from the new overflow tube to get the correct height as in the instructions tell you.  Adjustments were great since I could adjust everything. Low flush, full flush and how much water in the tank and the the bowl too. The best part is that my house guests notice no difference with using the toilet. Down is a normal flush.I bought a second unit after 2 months and will buy a 3rd later also.

In researching what was available I came across a series of Wolfcraft instructional videos (they are easily found on the net). The result was that I bought two doweling jigs ... the \"Dowel Pro\" and the \"Dowel Quick\".  The Dowel Pro is a jig that the work is brought to ... while the Dowel Quick is a jig that one takes to the work (similar to the comparison of a circular hand saw and a table saw).  Both jigs are well priced ... and they both work.The Dowel Quick jig not only aligns holes in end boards it also centers the dowel holes in end boards.  The Dowel Pro does not center holes in end boards ... instead it only aligns holes in end boards (normally the holes will be off center).I think the Dowel Pro could be improved by providing two identical components.  The only down side to that would be that it would likely cost a bit more.Wolfcraft evidently also sells what they call the Dowelmaster ... which is basically just an improved model of the Dowel Quick.  I think it costs a bit more but it allows a much more convenient handling of the fence.

This thing is darn near as accurate as any top of the line meter, and at 20 bucks it's a steal.Sound meters aren't that complicated: a simple little mic picks up the sound pressure and then shows it on the display. Analog is inexact because the peaks are so transient, thus digital is a superb upgrade. You can measure exact peaks, save them, and find ranges and other fun stuff with this meter, which is the size of a thin, flat 12 oz plastic bottle or so. It's very light, the battery easy to install, and the only cheap thing is that the plastic screen is laid in and warps a tiny bit. But for most uses, so what? Sound meters are used for brief studies, and rarely for all day or even hour at a time uses.I was offered this as a sample, and expected it to be half-assed, but it's actually a very solid unit that works well and is built quite sturdily. For 20 clams it's a truly fine deal.PS To any musicians out there: if you ever get noise complaints, simply get one of these and a video camera and film yourself or a friend using it in the room and then outside; the police will appreciate not having to come out all the time. Most communities have an 80 db limit at your property limit: you'll be surprised how high that really is, and that maybe your complaining neighbors just wish they'd learned how to play too! And for any guitarist who gets assailed by band members for playing too loud: most bangin' rock drummers will be peaking out above 110, even near 120, measured right in front of the kit, whereas I've dimed Deluxes and Plexi half-stacks and not hit quite that level. Then again, drums are transient...but that and bass are what travel most. It's nice to have a meter to prove you have the God-given RIGHT to crank out those Jimi and Floyd and Zeppelin riffs at the proper volume!And on that note (B sharp, see?), please wear earplugs, folks. The best use of a sound meter is to know when you need them, and I highly recommend using ear protection for anything over 85 or so. My hearing is still excellent and I've been in front of cranked amps for over 30 years, so it's not the volume, but the protection you use. That's what he said...Protect your ears at all costs!

Had a low tire and eventually drove to the gas station to get air.  In part it's my fault because this is not really a consumer's tool.  It is an industrial tool and I should have read the manual before I purchased it.  You have to run it for 30 minutes to prepare the pressure.  Engine will turn off automatically when it's reached the proper pressure.  You have to understand that the smaller gauge is for the tank pressure and the larger one is for the regulator/output hose.  The regulator dial is used to release pressure into the attached hose.  It's recommended that you drain the tank daily by releasing the air to below 10 psi and unscrewing the tap on the bottom of the tank so it doesn't corrode.  Ok, let's get this straight.  Prepare tank (30 minutes) and then drain each day???  So maybe my previous 12 volt unit that took 3 minutes a tire on occasion and cost a 1/4 of this wasn't so bad.  I could even take it with me in case of an emergency.  So this product is probably getting a so so review because it isn't the right tool for the average consumer.  It's probably good for someone that uses pressure tools on the job, or spray painting.  For casual tire inflation it's over-kill.  Too late for me to return it and got rid of the box so can't sell it used/new.  Read the manual about the prep time and the daily maintenance if you don't believe me.

I read the reviews and figured at the worst, I would have a chop saw that I could at least use to just cut boards and stuff, which is fine. At best, I would have a fully capable miter saw capable of making precision cuts for a fraction of the cost of the more expensive &#34;pro grade.&#34;Well, I received the saw and was more than satisfied with the quality of the product. It's the same type of metal you'll find on any of these lower-end miter saws. In terms of build quality, you can compare this saw with anything at HD for under 300 bucks and it will be nearly identical.Blade: not great, but stock blades are never that great, even on $500+ saws. Always a good idea to invest in a quality aftermarket blade like Freud Diablos.Sliding action: functions well and low profile. I was worried this would be a weak point. It is not. A little lubricant would help here, as it doesn't glide effortlessly, but it is still smooth.Power: standard, adequate for just about any job and no different than any other saw in its class.Fence: it was off by a degree or two out of the box, as the directions prepare you for. A few minutes loosening and tightening the bolts that hold it and lining up with a straight edge and you are good to go. For people complaining about this, you really need to be realistic here; few saws are going to be perfect right out of the box.So here's where my review gets useful to most people. After having the saw about a week and using it to make a few cuts--including using an abrasive blade to cut through 1/4&#34; copper bar--I was one day using it to cut a gnarly piece of hickory wood. Cut was going well but then the stock blade dug in and kicked the wood violently against the fence. Fence snapped right in half. Bummer.So here I was thinking I'd relived the ol' &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; adage. I looked around online for the replacement part, but to no avail. Then, I saw the email address for WEN customer service listed on the manual. Sent them an email explaining the situation and had a reply (written in perfect English, mind you) within hours. They asked to see the Amazon invoice and that was that. 1 week later I received the new fence in the mail via expedited shipping. Now how is that for customer service?!You read horror stories all the time on these Amazon pages about trying to get service for devices--long holds on the phone, no callbacks, communication barriers, etc. Things get particularly bad in the tool department. Well, this was the antithesis of all that. WEN completely stands behind their product and has the customer service infrastructure to keep customers satisfied.This saw might not be the Rolls Royce of sliding miter saws, but it is certainly the best value you'll find, and should something go wrong, you'll have the peace of mind knowing that the problem will be taken care of quickly and easily.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 6, 2014", "summary": "Great value and excellent service!"}

That's a very neat function.However, the slotted mirror inside is actually glued to the case, making one wonder about the purpose of the slot in the first place.  On prying it loose one can look through the slot and use this as a signalling mirror, but one has to wonder why it was glued in.  I feel like I'm missing something there, and the SPARCE instructions (very sparce) didn't say.Several of the tools are inset into the case and held by tight-fitting plastic friction.  They actually include a cheap \"prybar\" tool with the case to pry those out of their holes... an annoying process (especially since the \"prybar\" is basically stiff wire and bends easily).

This Chop Saw Hood does fit into the \"accessory\" holes in the Ryobi, but so loosely that I was disatisfied with the wobble and ordered the optional $25 mounting brackets instead.  Even these aren't easy to find a place to attach to the Ryobi saw or portable stand I use, so I fabricated my mounting blocks to which I fastened the bracket.  I could have drilled a 9/16\" hole into the 4 inch thick block and spared myself the $25 for the optional brackets, but lesson learned.Ultimately the hood does help to contain a good portion of the generated saw dust, but I use mine indoors in a shop where I like absolute control over dust and debris, and this doesn't quite contain it all.  I'm going to modify mine to incorporate an intake port for a dust collector and to use the rain flap to enclose  more of the area in the front of the saw to increase the draw of the dust collector - hopefully without cutting into the functional space of the saw itself.For work site use, this may be useful in keeping the debris closer to the saw, but don't expect the hood to capture everything.  The saw still spits saw dust at you and the light stuff still gets carried into the air, so it will work its way all around an interior space. If you're using it outdoors, my guess is it's hardly necessary.  I doubt the hood and rain flap will hold up to a breeze, let alone strong wind.  But I'm not a contractor, so can't speak to that issue.As a hobbiest who uses the compound sliding miter saw in lieu of a cross cut sled or hand held circular saw, I find the Chopshop Saw Hood only marginally useful in containing dust and debris.

I once tried theADG Sports Securepistol safe, but was gobsmacked at how easily the door would pop open accidentally on that one.This Sentry Safe impresses with its small dimensions (it fits into bedside drawers that the ADG safe would not), its pry-resistant door design (the front lip is turned down to rob a pry bar of its upward leverage), and the speed with which the door opens -- after I programmed a combo, I thought I might have neglected to program the last digit, since it seemed to open before I finished pushing the final button, but it's just that fast.I was also pleasantly surprised by the reliability of the fingerprint programming.  I programmed my two index fingers, which took just a few seconds (the safe keeps re-scanning the same finger until it's satisfied -- it only took me four or five swipes for each finger), and then it reliably opened for those two fingers, and no others, every time I tried.  I haven't owned it long enough to know whether changes in humidity, temperature, or injuries to my finger tips (common when you're clumsy) will impact its reliability.My wife's fingers took quite a bit more training before they would register, and still resulted in a few false negatives (not letting her in) although thankfully no false positives, when we tried it on all the family members who were visiting for Christmas.Still, even if the fingerprint scanner doesn't let you in, there's the programmable buttons that you can use to open the safe (and, obviously, an override key).  My gripe with the safe is about how you interact with the buttons:  before you can input your key code (or scan your fingerprint) you have to \"wake up\" the safe.  You can wake up the safe by either putting your finger on the print sensor, or by pushing one of the buttons.  The first button that you push, however, doesn't count towards your code entry.So, if your code is 1-2-3-4-5 (please don't make that your code), you could not open the safe by pushing 1-2-3-4-5.  You would have to push 1-1-2-3-4-5 or 2-1-2-3-4-5 or X-1-2-3-4-5 (where X is the fingerprint sensor).  Unfortunately, you won't remember this until you've already pushed the first two buttons of your combo, and have to keep pushing buttons until the safe flashes a red light and refuses to open.  Then you can put your combo in again.I imagine this is a battery-saving function (BTW, 4xAA alkaline batteries only, says the manual), but it's a pain.  Why can't the first button wake up the safe AND count towards your combo?

Sure enough Mother Nature found our weak link and exploited our basement like Washington exploits our trust. Had Leak Frog been standing guard, there would have been enough time to run down to the local big box store and install a replacement pump on the fly before the damage was done. Purchased and installed a Zoeller M57 and Leak Frog from Amazon. Shortly thereafter, Mother Nature tested us again with a vengeance and overwhelmed our Zoeller. This time Leak Frog sounded and we had plenty of time to add another pump before the basement went under. It has been a few months now and Leak Frog remains poised for Mother Nature's next leap. Leak Frog at $14.95 claims the alarm sounds at \"over\" 95db with 3 AAA batteries. The Water Screamer at $44.95 claims 130db with one 9v battery. If you need to pierce three floors or a 30k/sq/ft McMansion with sound, then go with the Water Screamer otherwise the Leak Frog should do just fine. If you believe you may sleep through an alarm then go wireless with a detector, transmitter and alarm placed on your night-table. Wireless units can transmit up to 300ft. We now check our pumps on a regular basis for signs of life.UPDATE: Leak Frog set itself off this morning but the sump pit was barely wet. Upon closer examination there was condensation build up on both contact plates causing Leak Frog to sound. I had placed the unit on a level well above the usual small amount of water in the pit but I'm guessing the temperature differential between the masonry Leak Frog was sitting on and the plastic/metal materials Leak Frog was made from caused the condensation build up on the contacts. I placed a 4\" square sheet of plastic between Leak Frog and the masonry to act as an insulator. Will report back with results.UPDATE: Plastic sheet between LeakFrog and masonry worked. No false alarms.UPDATE:::::One year, seven months and 18 days later a loud static noise is now emanating from this unit. The test button is functioning and it does sound an alarm when the contacts come in contact with water but the new static sound is beyond annoying. I've installed fresh batteries and same result.

You wouldn't believe me if I told you how long ago I ordered it. I guess a fresh batch is in so order it quick. Now on to the item. When they say that it is accurate, the first thing I did, when I took it out of the box, was break out the Bosch Digital Protractor. It measures angles with a digital readout in tenths of a degree. (Equal to 3600 dots in a circle, no matter how small the circle) I put the miter gauge to the test. I clamped an aluminum level onto the face to extend the surface, and guess what? I got perfect readings after trying the detent stops, and even got the same results when I eyeballed a setting just using the pointer. It wasn't even off by a tenth of a degree.At first I was confused, because some of the stops weren't right on the number, then I realized that they have stops at the popular detents, and some of those are in tenths of a degree.Point number two is that I was impressed that the miter gauge bar that rides in your miter slot has little Allen bolts imbedded in it, so you can adjust it perfectly, to eliminate any play. When I put it in my Powermatic 66, it fit so perfectly, without any play, that I don't even need to fiddle with it. It is so snug that you would have to measure the play in thousandths of an inch, as in non-existent, yet it slides along the track like it was on greased wheels. It fit my Bench Dog miter track on their Router table extension for table saws the same way. The Might T track miter track guides had a little slop in it, but that is obviously the track and not the gauge. I guess you can tell where I will be using it. (Although the play is adjustable for any 3/4 x 3/8 track)Point three is that the bottom of the gauge is polished so smooth that it will not scratch your saw tabletop. The front face of the gauge where you rest your work, looks like it was fine ground-polished with something like a 1000 grit wheel. You can see ultra-ultra fine lines going in a circle from where it was fine machined.I strongly recommend that you also get Delta's clamp attachment that works with this gauge. The one that I bought is the 34-568 clamp assy, and it fits and works perfectly. Delta and Amazon feature the Delta cheapy miter gauge with the clamp as a combo package for about the same money as buying this Deluxe gauge and the 34-568 clamp assy as separate pieces. So for about the same money you are getting Delta's best, and in this example it is worthy of that title.The gauge and clamp combo perfectly resolves the problem of when you are trying to cope the ends of your rails in a raised panel bit set. You know the problem, you have to hold that two-inch wide board and run the bit over the tip. Trying to get the bit to not move the board, by either pushing it a little away from the fence, or run into the second fence face causing a stop is a major accomplishment. Many use sleds with clamps on them, but then you are raising the work piece off of the table to make up for the sled base plate. With a router, that is a major consideration, because that oftentimes leads to having to raise the bit higher up out of the collar, causing more vibration and potentially a dangerous bit flying condition. This gauge and clamp combo locks it in just the same, but keeps the work piece flat against the tabletop. The other advantage to that is if you are running some larger pieces at the same time, you can do it by removing the gauge, and not have to change a bit setting. Wow! I'm getting off on this, I don't know about you. :-)Another point is that the picture doesn't do it any justice. The fit, the finish, the accuracy of the deluxe gauge is better than any other miter gauge I have seen, even the one that came with the Powermatic saw. I can't recommend this high enough. Is it because it is a waxed Ferrari sitting in the garage? No, it is because it is as accurate and fine as a miter gauge can get. Buy one, you won't be sorry.

If you have 300 to 400 pounds of cast iron tool on 4 small wheels, the floor has to be clean and smooth for the wheels to roll.  Wood chips, saw dust, power cords, or any small item will stop the tool from rolling because it is a lot of weight on a very small wheel.  I have 3 tools on mobile bases in my shop now, and they all are very picky about wanting a clean unobstructed surface to roll on.A couple of reviewers complained that the screws for the side rails would strip out.  Since I didn't buy one of these I can't say much, but I can tell you that those screws are not load bearing.This base does not have a quick release lever for setting the brakes, and I think that is a great feature to have.

Plastic toy chair. (see pix above) Now, to you and me this chair looks like a clear throw-away, but to my little girl, it was worth fighting for. It's an awkward thing to glue (it's so thin, it's like walking a tightrope and the seams didn't match up exactly, leaving gaps). I don't have a clamp that can hold it so I simply put some packaging tape on the front and ran a line of Advanced ProBond on the back. I waited until it looked clear before moving it (about 30 minutes). It worked! And worked well. My daughter didn't love the faint blue line where the glue showed through the gap to the front, but it stayed together well and she will quickly overlook that. The back looks clearly like a dried line of glue.2nd task: Ceramic mushroom. This one was super tough. It not only was near impossible to line up the surfaces (being randomly bumpy) but there was NO clamping it. It is on a spike you put into the ground, so the only \"clamping\" is gravity. Turns out I didn't line it up well (I couldn't see that low to the ground to adjust it) but Advanced ProBond still worked. It lined up poorly but held its own! The things I could repair with this would save us a good amount of $$ over the years. See picture section above.If you have only some small tasks to repair, the 2 oz bottle should be sufficient, but you don't save much in $$.My one criticism is the color. It dries pale blue.Although I received this product in exchange for a review, this review is honest and no one is pressuring me to vote positively. I would recommend this glue to anyone.

I tested this function by unplugging the unit from the AC wall outlet, and the large, very bright 15-LED light came on instantly and stayed on until I turned it off.2. Flashlight. The on/off switch turns on the 5-LED light (straight ahead like a regular flashlight) or the 15-LED light on the side (like a lantern).3. Motion sensor light. Passing in front of the sensor in darkness turned on the 15-LED light, which remained on for about 20-30 seconds. It illuminated a surprisingly large area for such a small light.

Now, if you were in the business of fence-building, and wanted a true pro-quality tool, go with something like the Knipex Co-Bolt cutters, but keep in mind they are about 5X as expensive, as well.I'd say that these work well for cutting unhardened bolts up to about 1/4 inch (although it WILL take some effort to do it in one snip) and maybe 3/16&#34; for a grade 5 bolt.

This looks like it will do the job and be useful for drilling large holes in lumber as well. It's a quality tool, and comes with a decent case which I think is essential, and I don't believe in paying $50+ extra for one. It is heavy (8.25lbs) so I can't see myself using it on a ceiling.I also purchased a HA3JAW keyless chuck to use with large regular shank drill bits at thirty five, this adds another 0.75lbs. When latched into the SDS chuck it has about 1/2\" of forward back movement. Apparently this IS normal for an SDS shank chuck or drill bit-\"The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide back and forth like a piston. The hammer of the drill acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes hammer drilling with an SDS shank drill bit much more productive than with other types of shank\". This probably means that the optional HA3JAW keyless chuck should only be used in drill mode, even if you have round shank masonry drill bits.The RH328VC case has storage for small parts, drills, etc and also a generous area for coiling up the power cable. The case appears to be an improved design -the one that came with my Bosch 3/8\" drill is worn out -the \"living\" hinges and the latches are all broken on that (the drill still works fine though). This case has seperate hinges and latches. I'm not that familiar with SDS but originally it was named by Bosch 'The SDS bit was developed by Bosch in 1975 and the name comes from the German \"Steck - Dreh - Sitz\" (Insert - Twist - Stay)'.Both the RH328VC and the HA3JAW, are Made in Germany.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 3, 2012", "summary": "Bosch RH328VC 1-1/8-Inch SDS Rotary Hammer"}

You could put it out if you have a pool or take it anywhere but it's sizeable though.For my night table and Sirius radio, this works great and I do like it. In comparison to some smaller speakers I own, the sound doesn't equal and is less in quality than my other little Bluetooth speakers.I'd say for a kid's room, this would be great but wouldn't hold up to a lot of shenanigans and would be best stationery on a bedside table or desk where you can enjoy the color changing light.

I think who ever is drinking the last of the OJ or milk and putting the empty carton back into the fridge is responsible for these stray batteries. ;)Seriously though, I think we've all done this - change out batteries in electronic devices if the item isn't working up to snuff, and if you find the problem isn't the battery you now have a good battery out of the package and very often find it later, not sure, can't recall if it's good. You're faced with throwing it out and possibly wasting money on a good battery, keeping it in a junk drawer or it ends up rolling around on your desk for months before you get so sick of seeing it you just toss it in the garbage can.Because I hate wasting money I test any stray battery just in case. But testing it with the traditional battery tester can be time consuming and annoying, and for some of us it's also difficult. Most of us keep battery testers in the garage or basement, tucked away in a box of tools. And even if the tester is near by and easy to get to, traditional battery testers can be hard to use - especially if you have dexterity problems or a child in your lap. This tester allows you to slide the battery in and just squeeze to test. That's it. Very simple and easy.My husband bought this tester for me because I fumbled around so much with his regular battery voltage tester that has wires and clips. I have dexterity problems due to arm injuries but I find this easy to use. He also had another motive - he wanted me to stay out of his tool box, wanted me to have a tester of my own.Like the other reviewers, I took away one star because the indicator was a bit hard to read. I had to put on my reading glasses to be sure. I'd pay extra to have this with both the color graph index and a digital numeric read out.But still, I would in fact recommend this for basic household and office use, not just if you have dexterity issues, but also if you're someone who always has their hands full (like with kids) it's much quicker and easier to use than the traditional kind with wires and clips. It's also great for use by children.I keep mine in a drawer where I keep all my computer, camera, and electronics accessories, battery chargers, adapters, etc. We still keep the traditional battery tester with wires in with my husband's tools, because that kind works on just about any battery.I recommend this for mom's, care givers, office workers, kids - anyone who has items that run on AAA, AA, 9V, C, or D batteries. Have it handy in your home office or family room (not in a tool box) or where ever you keep your batteries. And be sure to show your kids how to use it so they don't waste money by throwing away batteries that are still good.One last thought. In an emergency, if you need to check batteries for a flashlight for example, this is much quicker and simpler than traditional battery testers. In an emergency you don't want to waste time with wires and the need for the pin point accuracy of touching clips and wires to the battery and tester.UPDATE:This is a perfectly good review yet two people have recently voted it as not helpful, these are the same two people who don't like my negative review of the very dangerous so called \"Art of Cure\" teething necklace and are voting down my other reviews just for spite.

I didn't do any extensive work, just cutting a plywood board. Then one battery died completely! It was still chargeable but dead with the tool. The other battery still worked. When I contacted Rockwell customer support they told me they can't change the battery on general warranty and they could just send me another one based on their lifetime battery warranty where I had to pay handling and shipping. So I returned the item to Amazon. I don't care if Rockwell shots them self  in the foot because just sending me a new battery without charging me for shipping/handling would likely be cheaper for them. We'll see if the replacement package has also problems or not. The tool itself is nice for the price and it comes with a lot of blades, two batteries and charger. So for the price it is a good value if it all works with the batteries included. The speed dial is maybe a little soft and can get changed unintentionally and the mounting system might be a bit sturdier and easier to handle, but for the price those are just small flaws and don't get in the way of the deal. The batteries need to be recharged frequently, but I expected this and the charger just needs half an hour to recharge a battery. So for the current pricing I'd say this is still a good deal. Other companies like Fein, Bosch and so on might be a tad better, but they cost a whole lot more. Just for a little cutting here and sanding there the Rockwell is just fine. Rockwell sells the same system for twice the price with a universal mount system, but I think it will not be needed. With this kit here there comes also a universal mount adapter. So you can also mount other blades from other companies with it. I subtracted the two stars just because of the faulty battery and the reaction of the customer support. Because if you buy a tool and one battery dies within an hour it would have been nice if they jumped over their shadow and just send me a new battery free of any charge. Much easier for me than to send the whole package back and to wait some days for the new package till I can hopefully continue with my work.Update:I received now my replacement kit and it works. Kudos to Amazon and the replacement/return process! Both batteries work fine and also the tool. So I upgraded my star rating from 3 to 4.

Also, I don't have to get out my square every time I turn my miter gauge back to 90 degrees!Basically, the only major adjustment you have to make is to ensure that your saw blade is parallel to the miter slot on the saw. Using the gauge is dead-simple, and the included instructions are clear and to the point. INCRA provides extra hardware to install your wood fence (i.e. to backup your cuts near the blade), and throws in a few extra pieces to boot!Most of the time, when you get stuff made in those \"overseas\" sweat-shops, you quickly see where they cut corners or barely made specs.

Previously I used the DEWALT DW2505 Rapid Load Holder but I found it was too long (3inches) and awkward.

And the magnet is designed to not over power the bit so that the bit slips out perfectly when released. No 'back holding' or tugging to remove the bit. This bit does it all and in a much more convenient, less bulky shorter 2in length vs 3in for the Dewalt.The Dewalt wobbles more and encourages bit walk due to it's longer length & looser tolerances. The Dewalt is also harder to control vs the shorter compact length of the Wera.  Precise, under control, and easier to pop off the bit for the next one this Wera has increased my drilling speed, comfort & efficiency.

This is the &#34;big brother&#34; of the Saw-Max SM20, which came in my set.  Not only is it heavier, but it uses larger blades.  I have had a few instances when the small blade on the Saw-Max necessitated my flipping the item over and sawing though the back.  For one project I needed to cut sheetrock and wall studs.  I started with the Saw-Max to cut the sheetrock and make sure there were no wires in the area, then used the Multi-Max MM20 to cut the stud.  The Saw-Max's maximum depth is 3/4&#34;.  It does have markings on the side that tell you what depth the blade is set for.  The Ultra-Saw does not.  The Ultra-Saw, with the included flush blade, would have allowed me to cut part of the stud, but I still would probably have reached for the Multi-Max to finish it.If you are a professional or a heavy user, you probably would be better off with a standard Skil saw.  For my uses (installation of a wall electric fireplace, replacing wood trim, cutting stone and metal mosaic tile, etc.) the lighter Saw-Max was great.  I do like the bigger blade and more power of the Ultra-Saw, but it is offset by the additional weight.

So it is a common favorite of many people...I generally prefer fixed blade drivers, but when you are far from the toolbox, having a driver that can be reconfigured with bits stored in the handle is a nice bonus.  Unlike some of the cheap ratcheting drivers, this one can hold up to heavier duty use.  I have yet to damage one of these.I also have had the Craftsman version of this tool, and they both seem to perform equally well.  Klein is generally higher quality than Craftsman, but I can't really see much difference for this particular tool.**UPDATE**I have ordered these in the past and was happy with what I got.  However I just ordered two more, and this time I received two Vaco versions of this tool.  The Vaco seem to be of nearly the same quality that I was expecting.  However the magnet is weaker than the Klein version.  I think that instead of a rare-earth magnet, Vaco uses a more ordinary Alnico magnet, so the magnet is weaker, and you are more likely to drop a screw or have the bit come out.

For the same price, they are dimmable, have a good color tone, a nice rubberized coating over the bulb that helps prevent breakage, and are also instant-on.

There are plastic blocks that act as large nuts to receive the bolts that hold the bamboo plywood planks to the metal framework.  The bottom part of each block has a narrow section that fits in a slot in the metal framework, and \"wings\" below the slot that push against the sides of the slot to resist the occasional upward force on the plank.  In normal use these plastic wings don't have to withstand a lot of force because gravity is keeping the planks in place.  When folded up and shipped in an unpadded cardboard carton, the frequent sideways forces from the truck starting and stopping will cause the heavy planks to rip the plastic wings off.  Each of the two sliding planks in my WM425 arrived with a broken plastic block.The instruction sheet that comes with the unit tells how to assemble the WM425 from separate parts.  Since these parts are almost all already in place, the conflicting instructions are confusing.  And Black & Decker seems to be in denial that the units are sent already assembled, because the customer service person proclaimed vigorously that the instructions matched the shipped units.  I had to mail in the broken plastic blocks to get replacements; this took about three weeks.---Once you get a working WM425 you'll have a very nice folding work table with a couple of limitations.  The table is fairly heavy, so folding and unfolding is a bit cumbersome.  For twice-a-weekend frequency it's OK; you probably wouldn't want to fold the table up hourly.  The second limitation is the clamping system, which slips after you apply moderate force.  I haven't found anything that required more gripping force than I needed, yet.I'm building a router table that uses the WM425 as a base.  With the middle plank removed there's adequate clearance for even a large router, and the other two planks will clamp onto cleats on the underside of the removable table top to keep everything very stable.  When I don't need the router table it'll pop off the WM425 and hang from a wall hook, and the WM425 will fold to free up garage space.Summary: Very nice folding work table which will support heavy materials and clamp fairly large pieces for you to work on.

If you turn it on with the POWER button you'll likely be frustrated.The INSP-3 is a professional hand-held tester that checks GFCI, AFCI, Polarity, Voltage Drop, True RMS voltage and Ground Impedance on 120 volt single phase circuits. It does not check the condition of the insulation.It has a standard NEMA 5-15 three-prong plug you insert into the receptacle to be tested.  If you want to test a circuit with old-fashioned 2 prong receptacles, you'll need to supply your own adapter.The instructions included with this tool are rather brief.  I struggled for 10 minutes trying to test for voltage drop on a GFCI circuit before I figured out that I should NOT turn the tester ON before using it!  To be clear, the instructions don't actually say \"Turn the tester on\".  I just assumed that pressing the POWER button was the first step ..... my mistake!After that, the tester worked great.  I went all through the house testing receptacles and found the living room circuit, which is the farthest from the service panel, has excessive voltage drop (11% @ 20 amps).  That explains why my chop saw functioned so poorly that time I used it on the front porch and powered it with an extension cord from the living room.GFCI testing reports the milliamps required to trip the device as well as the time (in tenths of a second) that elapsed before it tripped.  This tester found one GFCI in my home that consistently tripped during the 15 amp load test, never allowing me to proceed to the ground fault test.  That GFCI device has never given me trouble, so I'm impressed that the tester identified the problem.Sorry that I was unable to test the AFCI function of this tester.  My home was built long before AFCI devices were required, or even available.This tester will become a valuable part of my DIY tool kit and I highly recommend it.  I deducted one star for the brief instruction pamphlet.  It seems that a tool this expensive should have a proper manual.Mike", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2013", "summary": "A very good tester with poor instructions"}

The door is a solid wood 18x7 door. The old opener had stopped functioning reliably long ago from what I was told and this one looked like a nice one to try out. I did get to see and hear the original open work several times so I would be able to compare the sound and smoothness of operation later.I got my dad to help and we set about pulling the old opener down and installing the new one. We took our time and followed the instructions and we had it all done in a couple of hours. I was lucky that the old ceiling bracket worked perfectly with this opener as it saved a lot of time, money, and effort because I didn&#8217;t need to purchase and install a new one.  The sensor mounts didn&#8217;t want to clip to my track as it seemed to be too big. I cut off a couple of pieces from a 2x4 and mounted the brackets to those and then used construction adhesive and a long screw to mount them at the bottom if the door on the frame just outside of the track. The only real issue I had that I didn&#8217;t think I should have had was that the sensor wires weren&#8217;t long enough.  I could have used just a couple more feet but it wasn&#8217;t there.  Luckily I had just run new thermostat wire in the house so I had extra. A couple pieces of wire and some wire nuts and I was in business.Setting the travel, aiming the safety sensors, testing, and then configuring my car remote was no problem. I have a 2013 car and everything worked fine but I understand some older cars may need a repeater in order for the home link controls to work. You get a couple of remote units for in the car so if you don&#8217;t have controls built into your vehicle or if yours don&#8217;t work you aren&#8217;t totally out of luck. You also get a keypad with a cover to mount outside that you can easily set a code on and use for external access. I had read that the Liftmaster Internet Gateway would work with the Chamberlain as they were the same so I opted to get one. It was easy to set it up so I could also run the opener from my Android phone.The first time I heard the opener operate it was pretty amazing. I had never heard a belt drive opener before and when compared anything I had heard before the difference was huge. It is so quiet that most of the sound comes from the door track. I also like that the opener shows down as it approaches the end of its travel so the door doesn&#8217;t slam open or closed like the old opener did. Another great thing is that the wall panel has that motion sensor that will automatically turn the lights on if you want. We go out into the garage frequently as we have storage and keep recycling out there and the automatic light is a very convenient feature. It turns the light on as soon as we step foot in the garage and shuts them off shortly after we leave.So far this opener has been working about a month now without incident and I am very happy with it. If this unit looks like it may be something you are looking for I&#8217;d definitely recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2013", "summary": "Great opener"}

Especially at first this mostly involved me standing around a lot and running and getting him tools and supplies when asked, and one of my earliest memories of fetching a tool for my dad was getting him a hammer.  I went down into the basement and grabbed the nicest looking hammer and came running back with it.  \"Oh, no, sorry, but I wanted your grandfather's hammer--the one with the brown leather handle,\" he said.  \"Could you please run and get that for me instead?\"  I was perplexed.  I knew the hammer he was talking about, and it was a rusty, beat up looking thing with a weird handle!  Why did my dad want THAT hammer?  Just because it had been his dad's maybe?  I didn't know, but, I ran down and got him that hammer instead.  I soon learned that when my dad wanted a \"hammer\" he wanted THAT hammer--evidently his favorite hammer.The hammer in question was, of course, a 16 ounce straight claw leather handled Estwing, and later, when I got old enough to do more than fetch tools--when I actually started swinging a hammer myself--then I understood.  That Estwing was just plain RIGHT.  It felt right, it struck right, it was absolutely rigid and true, and despite the way the old leather handle may have looked to my childish sensibilities, the thing just felt really good in your hand.  There was no contest.  It was by far the best of the half dozen or so hammers my dad had scattered about.And it was, apparently, already one generation old!I don't know where I got my gene for organizing and taking good care of my tools, but it certainly wasn't from my dad.  That Estwing hammer got left out lying on the lawn in the rain more than once; it was literally used hard and (not) put away wet!  So eventually, long after I had graduated from college, one of the rings in the handle broke apart thus allowing the rest of them a great deal of play and slippage, thus practically ruining the hammer.  I honestly don't remember whether I asked permission, or if I just stole it, but either way, I took that hammer--MY favorite hammer--from my dad.  I carefully cut some sections of thick leather to push into missing section to get rid of the play and fill in the channels of the tang (it's like an I-beam) and then I wrapped waxed linen cord around and around to finish filling in the void and bring the hammer back into working order.  It worked out really well, and the handle was firmer and more secure than ever.I went to all this trouble because I just assumed that it was no longer made and I loved it!Then, one day, I saw a 16 ounce leather handled Estwing with a curved claw in a hardware store and did a bit of looking into it, and found out that Estwing still made that exact hammer--my grandfather's hammer!  Who would have believed it!?!  So I had the store order me the straight claw version (because who in their right minds wants a curved claw?  Anything a claw hammer can do, a rip hammer can do better.)So, I now own my grandfather's Estwing, and my own, much newer (and much better cared for) version of the exact same hammer.  And both make me very happy.I have used many dozens of different hammers over the years for everything from roofing to framing to finish work, and this Estwing is still one of the best hammers ever made and I love it and would never ever part with it.  It is beautiful, functional, and of the highest quality.  Forget all the fancy new fangled MIG welded, titanium, fiberglass, death-on-a-stick, carbon fiber, replaceable face hammers out there.  This is the one you want.  Once you have this one, go ahead and flirt with others--you will always come back.It's just plain right.  And it will last a lifetime.  Or longer.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 13, 2014", "summary": "The best hammer ever made - still"}

If so, simply select your preferred Leviton wallplate (see images and videos above) and seamlessly \"sandwich\" it (no unsightly screw-holes) between the pictured two-piece Leviton Mobile Station (consisting of mounting bracket plus cradle). If not, the Leviton Mobile Device Station is still potentially useful but will require a new screw-hole (or 2) and some creative gerrymandering to conceal the mounting bracket.]After collecting several mobile devices, I soon realized that I needed a better system for organizing them.  Attaching one to a computer's USB port and another to a speaker dock helped me avoid the appearance of clutter but did not solve the problem of making my primary device accessible when I needed it most.One solution that I was already familiar with is 3M's Command Recharging Station, which uses adhesive strips to mount a holder on a wall, within arm's reach of your favorite iPhone or iPod TouchCommand HOM-11 Recharging Station with Adhesive Strips.  It's fast, less expensive (but not by much), and reasonably effective (I have yet to experience a station falling off the wall, so I can't comment on damage, if any, to the underlying surface).  But it's neither decorously understated nor reassuringly secure (I've noticed that the thin, brittle plastic cracks and shatters quite easily).  In short, the Command Station is more of a \"provisional workaround,\" useful in a dorm-room setting, whereas the Leviton Station is a lasting solution for the home.Compared to the thin and breakable plastic \"cup\" of the Command station, the Leviton is a durable \"fixture,\" offering its owner a choice of decor-matching colors.  Moreover, the Leviton cradle provides two stabilizing \"arms\" that pinch lightly against a phone or iPod, holding it securely in place.  Given the several \"apps\" on my Touch that are configured to serve as remote surrogates, running everything from my iTunes library to my Roku box to a DVR, the Leviton station has become a necessity.  In fact, anyone who's tired of hearing, \"Where's my cell phone?,\" would do well to purchase extra stations for other members of the household, especially if available AC outlets are conducive (see above \"caveat\").As for the installation of the Levitron Station: once a user-accessible AC outlet is located and a wall plate selected, all that's required is a screwdriver (but no new screw holes). The back of the cradle can be offset on either side to provide sufficient space for a squarish or bulky power adapter.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2012", "summary": "The best bet for the home."}

While CFLs have gotten way better in this department, the lag time to fully turn on is still apparent.Durable: Unlike a normal lightbulb or CFL, this bulb is more durable. I believe the outer housing is mostly plastic.Safer: CFL's emit UV radiation. However so does the sun and tanning beds. The effects of CFL UV radiation probably depend on placement of the bulb and factors like how close people are to it and how long they hang around the bulb's area of effect. I could be wrong, but LEDs do not have this problem. Continuing the safety discussion, this is a really minor point since I've never personally broken a CFL bulb; nor do I know anyone else  who has. However if it happens, CFLs contain approximately 1000 times the lead of a normal lightbulb. With this LED bulb, I do not believe you'll have that problem. I don't know what LED light bulbs contain, but I do know that they're much harder to break. Someone may or may not correct me on this point.Normal looking: This is another really minor point, since I personally loved the weird yellow Phillips LED bulbs. Even now, I don't think even this bulb can match the latest generation in terms of lumen output. However, they look really weird. It's hard to use them in places where you can actually see the bulb. Yes they look normal when turned on, but depending on the light fixture and the style of your home, it may or may not work for your aesthetically. With this particular LED bulb, you won't have that problem. It looks completely normal with a neutral off white color.[Bad]Price: While these type of bulbs are going down in price year after year, they are currently about 4 times or more expensive than an equivalent CFL for the same lumen output and about the same energy savings. Phillips is also even more expensive than other LED bulbs. In Phillips' defense, they have the best LED bulbs in terms of lumen output.[Verdict]If you value quality and safety over price, you can't beat the Phillips line of LED lightbulbs.

Additionally, as an engineer, experimenting with LED lights is also weirdly enjoyable and appeals to my \"Dilbert\" core.This Philips LED bulb is about the fifth LED bulb in the A19 size that I've tried. These bulbs are supposed to more or less substitute for the common 50w-60w incandescent bulbs that have been the home lighting mainstay for many years now. I've used this bulb for a week and have the comments below:Pros:1. Small enough to fit in any fixture that will accept a similar output incandescent bulb.2. Looks more or less \"normal\" compared to the bulbs with strange shapes and finned heat sinks on them.3. Throws a nice, even light pattern, even to the sides as well as the top or front end.4. The \"Daylight\" color balance is nice and white. I have posted a comparison photo on this page that compares this bulb with two other LED bulbs and incandescents which are \"tungsten\" or indoor balanced.** It is important to know what color balance you want because LED lights are targeted for a certain \"warm\" or \"cool\" output. If you pick the wrong one, it will look out of place or give an undesired effect.5. Appears well constructed and not tremendously fragile.6. The packaging does not require tools to take apart.6. It is not as heavy as some LED bulbs, so it does not cause the light fixture to become unbalanced.7. Dimmable. Compatible with my solid state, X-10 remote computer controlled dimmer. Many LED bulbs are not. If you are using LED bulbs in a multiple light fixture, it is often necessary to use at least one incandescent in the mix to keep the trickle current from powering on the LED bulb. This Philips bulb does NOT seem to have the problem.Cons:None so far.My ranking of A19 sized bulbs from my personal use:1. Philips 425264 (Subject of this review) - nice little light that doesn't exhibit any abnormal behavior. White daylight color balance.2. GE Lighting 68017 Energy Smart LED 11-watt 800-Lumen - Mostly well behaved, although it is not fully solid state dimmer compatible (stays partially on). Big plus is that it looks like a normal light bulb in almost all ways, especially the shape.3.  Feit Electric 13.5 Watt LED Omni 60w Incandescent replacement - Nice light output and great price ($10 at Costco). But, it looks weird and is heavy. It has the poor \"off\" characteristic mentioned in the review.4. LED Light Bulb, 900 Lumen, Warm White, 9 Watt (65W Replacement) by G7 Power - Good light with efficient output. It looks close to a regular light bulb, BUT it is BIG. This is not explicitly mentioned in the product description. I found it would not fit inside of some glass globe fixtures that would accept more normally proportioned bulbs. Does work with a dimmer, however. Relatively expensive.5. Lights of America - these are the crappy lights that were available at Costco under the \"Lights of America\" name. Pure crap. Avoid - faults are too numerous to list, but the big one is it doesn't provide enough light to be usable for most purposes.

First I tested it on several bonafide squares, but the Bosch consistently measures off by .3 degrees.  Not huge, but enough to be concerned about when buying a precision tool.  I searched the instructions, only to learn there seems to be no method an end user can set it to a 90 deg benchmark.  In my opinion, this is a shortcoming.  Nothing that is flexible like this, which can also get banged around, will maintain pefect calibration.  Of coruse, one solution is to always add .3 degrees to the reading.  But I am not sure how it will fare at 45 degrees, 23 degrees, etc.I will not repeat much of what has been written about other shortcomings such as size the inabillity to hold data, etc.  But every tool has its limitations, so its the users responsiblity to match his/her needs with a tools capabilities.  The reason I gave this 4 stars is, the market place is lacking highly accurate angle finders.  So this product fills that void well, and although it could use some improvements, overall, its still very useful vs. any other device I have found.  And although others find the price high, I would disagree, as for a precision instrument such as this, I consider the price fair.  Measuring angles in high precision is much more difficult then making other measurements such as distance, depth, etc.ultimately, a more accurate device would probably be a  dial type scale, which gains huge accuracy from gearing.  The digital aspect can easily be incorporated into such after the reading is had.Also, if you are using angled cuts for short width pieces, tiny inaccuracies such as this, are not an issue.  The issue arises when the angle cuts are long as the slight inaccuracies become visible in the finished product.Update, 1/20/06.....  I was fooled....  I spent $95 for a high precision CNC square, which is checked for accuracy to .05 Degrees.  This was my new benchmark to test the Bosch, and I was much surprised to see it read 89.9 Degrees, making it well within its specification range of .1 degrees.  This demonstrates you only get what you pay for, and not all squares are square, even though you spend good money for them.  Now, the Bosch is quite the tool, and very accurate, which is critical for me.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2005", "summary": "Good tool, but not perfect"}

These aren't top-of-the-line lights, but they do provide a great compact flashlight for the price.  These were the lights that I kept in my glove box or thrown in with my camping gear before I discovered the PackMate lights.One of the best things about these lights is the multiple output levels.  They can be set to the low brightness setting that will give you excellent battery life for standard use, or they can be bumped up to a higher brightness if you need to really light something up.  Unfortunately, this is also the most irritating thing about the light since the switch to toggle modes is a sequential push button; so you have to cycle through all the modes every time you turn the light on.Just to be clear, the brightness/focus of this light definitely isn't as good as other lights that cost several times more money.  But, for the price, I don't think they can be beat.  If you are used to using any size MagLite (or comparable flashlight) instead of a top-of-the-line SureFire or Streamlight, then you will be amazed by the brightness of these.Even with the irritating switch, I would still recommend the TwinTask flashlights if you absolutely need it to be black.  If you are OK with either green or orange camo I would recommend the Streamlight PackMate lights instead.

I needed one pretty quickly because of some new aluminum wheels I was installing and didn't want to over-torque the wheels.  I picked this one, despite its relatively high cost because the digital readout with its instantaneous reading seemed very appealing and it had a nice range of 20-150 ft/lbs.The tool itself is long (as all torque wrench are) which can be an issue in tight quarters or even if you're torquing lug nuts since it will bump into the fenders at most angles.  But the advantage of the length is that you can be much smoother when tightening which is essential to getting an accurate torque reading.  For lug nuts either a deep socket or an extended will be necessary on most cars.The tool seems made well, and work well.  The plastic body leads me to treat this a bit gingerly, but I don't know that its necessary. I suspect I will drop it at some point accidentally and I'll know for sure).  It requires 3 AA cells which are not included.  The instructions provided are brief and to the point.You set the appropriate scale (ft/lbs or nt/m) and then set the desired torque amount.  The numbers are shown on a backlit LCD display.  As you use the tool, there are 3 LEDs that tell you what's happening.  Green means you're applying torque, yellow means you're close (within 20%) and when you hit the red led and you hear a beep, it means you're hit it.  The tool will display torque applied as its being used and will display peak torque.It couldn't be simpler.The one flaw comes from the auto-off feature.  The tool will power off in a couple of minutes, which is fine, but when it does, it forgets everything, most annoyingly the target torque you've set.  Its not a huge deal, but every time you set the tool down and come back to it, you start all over again.  It didn't seem right so I looked through the manual and there seems no way to save your torque.That said, the tool works very well at what it does.

It never shake or get stiff to operate.Dust collection is not working well but I think this problem is same on all other miter saws. Saw itself diffuses dust to all direction, so there is no way to collect it all from one direction.Dual beveling is a real time saver in crown moulding jobs and it's easy to operate. Frequently used angles are already set up in the saw, it saves time and can get accurate cut too.When working with other finish carpenters, my Bosch always cut all the pieces more precise than DeWalt and Makita.I believe this is the best miter saw on the market.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 25, 2007", "summary": "Excellent miter saw"}

The light output is just barely the equivalent of a 40W light spread out over about three feet. For underneath a cabinet in the kitchen, that is a fairly dim light that just barely fills in the shadows. The color of the light is very close to a regular light bulb, just slightly warmer.The kit is as pictured, three strips of LED lights encased in a clear plastic, the wall wart with an on/off switch (very handy), and two short connector wires. The kit also includes a mounting bag including double sided tape, some screws, and clear plastic U shaped clips. There are no instructions included in the box.The quality of this kit is excellent. The plastic is crystal clear and the strips look well built. Each light strip has an open end for the electrical connector. The opposite end is covered with a tiny clear plastic plug. To attach the strips together, remove that plug. The strips can be connected together directly and form one long solid bar, or the wire connectors can be added (two wires can be connected together to make a longer flexible connection).Assembly and mounting was very simple. For my application, the double sided tape worked perfectly.The lights are a lot dimmer than I expected. Although LED Christmas lights might not be as discreet, they give off way more light than these bars and are a lot cheaper. The other problem is the light cast by these bars. Because these bars are made up of a bunch of light sources, each lamp creates a shadow. If the light is pointed directly down on the counter, each object has about six different shadows. The effect is really ugly.For a kitchen under counter application, these lights are way too dim. For mood lighting, or a night light, these are perfect. This will work out just fine for my vinyl LP station in the basement. These have just enough light so that I can see if the records are clean, but not so bright that it is annoying.Overall, this is not a bad kit. I was hoping to replace a band of fluorescent under counter lights with these. Unfortunately, they are way too dim for that purpose.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "09 14, 2011", "summary": "Kind of Dim"}

So far, it has worked quite well.As far as power, this is your standard B&D; 3.6V rechargable screw driver and is about on par with the competition. For light duties around the house, it'll do just fine. Just keep in mind these aren't drills or high powered screw drivers. If you find that it runs out of power, you probably need a more powerful unit.The light works. But just barely. It's not very bright, but does help out in certain situations. It will also dim if the screw driver starts to have to work harder than usual. It also features a swivel adjustment so it can be used as a normal straight screw driver or at an angle as pictured. However, since it is rather bulky in either configuration, I normally just kept it in the angle position.It's very easy to grip and hold on to thanks to the rubber moldings at key locations. It's also light weight and even has a place for 1 extra bit. Battery life, also right about average for other B&D; 3.6v screw drivers. Just charge it up over night and it'll last quite awhile. Li-Ion would be nice, but that would also cost a lot more. For basic use around the house, fast charge times and super long life aren't a priority. At least not with this model!One important feature that's missing is a torque setting. This prevents me from using it with more sensitive electronics where even 3.6V can be too much. But at this price point, I guess you can't expect too much!Pros:* Built-in Light* 2 Angle Adjustement* Descent battery life* Rechargable battery* Powerful enough for most jobs around the houseCons:* No Torque Setting* Somewhat bulkyOverall considering it's price and features, I would recommend this screw driver.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2010", "summary": "Gets the job done"}

I spent too much time trying to decide between this and the full kit.  The low price convinced me to start with this one.First, the kit and case are amazing.  The case has spots for holding the jig, bit and drill.  The case also has the adjustments and measurements on the side for knowing where to position the stop collar on the drill bit.You set the drill bit and stop and you adjust the legs on the drill jig to your material thickness.  Then you clamp the jig onto your material (little feet on the legs go over the end of the material).  I started by using my own clamps.  You then drill the hole.Because the jig guides the drill bit, I was even able to let my 7 year old drill the pocket holes.  The wood chips come out of the holes in the jig so you don't have to go back and forth to clear it. Clamp the two pieces of wood together and drive with the nice long square drive bit included and it will actually pull the wood together.The system is actually much more flexible than I thought when purchasing it. What I didn't realize was the legs can come off the jig and can be positioned so the feet don't hook over the wood but instead can fit into a corner to do repair or retrofit work. They even have a size guide on the other side for just that reason.We actually had so much fun working on projects that I ended up buying the K4 system as well. This is a good thing.  You end up with an extra bit and extra drill and a jig that you can position anywhere. Buying one actually makes you want the other.ProsIt does what it says remarkably wellOutstanding case / you will want to keep it in there foreverGreat starter system that's still useful if you decide to upgradeLow costConsThe screws aren't free (but aren't ridiculous either)The jig isn't as wide as the bigger system so for wider boards (say 3 inches) you have to reclamp the jig on both sides instead of drilling both without reclampingOverall one of those purchases that brought a smile to my face.

While I could not live without it, a few things always bugged me - and they all got fixed in this version.  It was enough that purchasing it was a no-brainer.The biggest improvement is the built-in offset lip with markings for all typical lumber sizes.  In the old one I had to actually screw the lip that is used to align to the edge of the board on using two screws - and if I was using 2x material, add a spacer using different size screws - and if I was using anything else I had to measure and line it up manually.  Good if I was doing a lot of boards, but a real pain for one or two and worse if I was switching back and forth!  With this new model, just press in on the tab and slide the gray guide forward until it snaps into place at the mark for the size board I am using.Second, with the lip in place, the Kreg clamp I was using was trapped in the jig and if I wanted to use it for something else, or just put it away, I had to unscrew the lip.  Done away with in the new model, there is a spot sized for the clamp that is proud of the jig.  Very easy.Third, this comes in a nice little case that holds everything but the clamp.  My other was part of a set of Kreg jigs so when I wanted to throw it into the toolbag to go to a work site, I had to put all the parts in, and some would eventually go missing.  Now I can put the case into the toolbag, very handy.Fourth, the jig from the old set that showed where to set the drill stop required me to lift the drill out of it in order to get the stop on, and of course it would sometimes slip when I tightened it so I have to recheck and sometimes adjust.  Honestly it was such a pain that I got an extra bit and stop just so I could leave one set for 3/4\" material and one for 2x material.  In the new model the jig is part of the case AND holds the bit at each end, leaving space for the stop so I can tighten it without moving the bit.Clearly Kreg is listening to their customers and making very handy and sensible improvements while maintaining their high quality.  Like I said, buying this one even though the old one still works was a no-brainer.

It's also easy to set a clamped fence on the wrong side of the pencil line getting a piece that is either too wide or too narrow. Another problem with clamped fences. Is the fact that the built in circular saw guides are at different widths from the saw blade, depending on whether cutting from the left or the right side. I use the Kreg rip cut tool to make reliably accurate slices from horizontal sheet goods that rest on a homemade portable box frame table. Set up for different blades and widths is very fast. By keeping a dedicated saw attached to the Kreg tool I'm able to cut different widths in seconds. The only design flaw I noticed is the length of the fence.

It is SHELF LIFE. The only reason I see to buy these is to put the tool away for a year and still have it work when you need it.  Otherwise don't spend the money..you can buy two packs for the price of one Li pack so why buy it.  I like using a pro tool but I do not use it often.  My two standard pacs lasted 5 years but I only used them once a year...they only lasted 5 charges!!!  I use corded tools most of the time but once in a while I need cordless.  I want it to work when I need it and not require charging...I also do not want to buy new battery packs unless they have been used for their normal life charge re/charge.One more thing about LI-ION packs that apply to anything like cell phones and laptops.  Want to shorten their life...leave them in the charger.  Cell phone batteries last long because they charge overnight and get used all day OUT OF THE CHARGER. Also, if you are not using a LI-ION device and plan to leave it on the shelf DO NOT STORE THEM FULLY CHARGED AND STORE THEM IN A COOL PLACE OUT OF THE DEVICE.  They might last 10 years that way.  I do not know why chargers are not smart enough to discharge a LI-ION battery if left in a charger more than overnight to 60% but I suspect that would anger most people who would not understand why.  Every battery technology has it's place and there is no one that is best for everything.Don't buy LI batteries for anything you use daily and then not use for a few days...stick with NiMH.  Got a laptop but use it mostly plugged in?  Get the battery out of it after running it halfway down.

There are no real instructions, which isn't really an issue, but I still have no idea how the little &#34;tension&#34; knob is supposed to work as it doesn't appear to make any difference when adjusted.Overall, if you do a lot of wire stripping this can be a very useful tool.

I already have another 18V Dewalt and this gave me the added hammer drive feature plus a second drill/driver. I have had the older one for some 6 years. It is a work horse although a bit heavy when you use it for extended periods especially overhead. The new 950 is a work horse as well and is made a bit sturdier with the metal drive train. It too is heavy. Neither drill/driver disappoints in terms of power. I have 4 batteries and only the non XRP batteries wane in heavy use. By the way I just learned that I can use the new Lithium batteries with either drill driver. I think this is a great design consideration on the part of Dewalt! Certainly this will lighten the unit in use. I will have to wait and see regarding balance when I purchase the Li ION batteries.The 950 has one LED to light the way and it is a handy feature but I do notice that in some areas the shadow the head casts makes the light somewhat less effective.I had an unpleasant experience with the first 950 I ordered. I was using it to install a storm door, i.e. light duty.I had freshly charged batteries and within just a few screw installs it would not operate upon trigger actuation. The LED would light but the drill motor did not turn in the low speed setting. I found that switching to the second or third speed setting would allow normal operation, even if I switched back to the lowest speed. Needless to say I sent it back. A new one arrived very quickly and seems to be OK although I did experience the same event once more (one time).So why did I rate this as a 4 star you say? Primarily because it is a workhorse and I expect it to hold up as my other unit does. I find the hammer drill feature to be the answer to driving deck lags and drilling into concrete for TapCons.

There are some things you should know before purchasing. First, you don't need a router table to use it. But you will need a straight edge, as long as your joint. I use the Eurkekazone guide, but you can get by with the edge of a commercial piece of plywood if it's well-cut.Now, the whole key to using this bit is setting it at the correct height, because you want it perfectly centered, as you will be routing half your edges from the top and the other half from the bottom. It helps--greatly--to have a thickness planer to ensure that your boards are all of the same thickness.To set it at the correct height, here's a way:1) After putting the bit in your router, find a hard, flat surface (like a flat board or the surface of your table saw). Then push your router down until the blade touches the surface, and lock it down.2) Measure--precisely--the thickness of the wood that you are joining. A micrometer is nice for this.3) Take the thickness of your wood, subtract it from the thickness cut by this bit (1.5 inches, or 38 mm), and divide by 2. Add this thickness to the thickness of the pieces you want to join. EXAMPLE: The wood you want to join is 22 mm thick. Subtract that from 38 to get you 16. Divide that by 2 to get 8. Add that to the wood thickness (22), and you get 30 mm.4) Now, using your router adjustment, raise your router base by the amount calculated--in the above example, 30 mm. This will center the bit exactly if you are careful.If you are joining multiple pieces and some have to be joined on both sides, always route the glue joint for that piece of wood from the same side (that is, either top or bottom). If after routing your joints and pushing your pieces together, you find that your pieces are slightly staggered (every other one alternately high or low), pass the appropriate side through the planer to even things up to perfection before gluing.I have a finger joint bit as well, but for most applications, I prefer the glue joint bit. While a finger joint provides more surface area, it also provides a very long path for the glue to navigate when squeezing the clamps, and the glue takes more time to get into a finger joint, meaning it can start to set up. The bottom line is that when you clamp over a finger joint, excess glue may not completely squeeze out, and the glue line can be more obvious. I use the finger joint occasionally for short pieces (like cutting boards), and when I use it, I usually dilute the glue to make it easier to spread and squeeze out.But my hands-down choice for big pieces like tabletops is the glue joint bit. With a good glue and a straight cut line, the joint is plenty strong, automatically aligns your wood, and creates a practicallly invisible glue joint. I would not join a tabletop together without it. It speeds up the whole operation because you won't waste your time trying to get the pieces aligned while your glue is drying. Major stress reduction!Hope that these suggestions are comprehensible and useful. Happy woodworking!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2007", "summary": "making the perfect glue joint"}

I have used craftsman [borrowed] and was not impressed...does anyone know who is actually making any given craftsman electric tool anyways?  I borrowed a dewalt from a guy who I know who refinishes tubs, cultured marble etc. He fanatically loves that dewalt, don't get me wrong it works great and from what I've seen is super durable BUT that damn thing weighs a TON! No joke.  It's also a substantial investment [not cheap]. I had  dual action that as many of you know is pretty usless for compounding, I don't care what kind of bonnet you use it just is not gonna happen.  I started doing research on line and then going into retail stores to \"finger\" the tools.  I really liked the balance, power and price of the Makita.  I have and still own several Makita tools and use them professionally with nearly no issue, when an issue does arise I have had great service with no repeat problems.  I got lucky as a local retailer was no longer carrying Makita tools if favor of their own \"in house\" brand that appears to be a Makita knock-off.  So I won't name the retailer, but they are a fairly big name based out of the midwest area.  Nontheless I was able to pick up this exact kit package for just over $100 on clearance, when a few weeks earlier the best price I was able to find was about $200.  Sometimes we get lucky! With a nice polishing bonnet I get great results.  I'd definitely buy again, as for my cheapie, I still use it for compounding and as a loaner to neighbors/friends who are learning the skill.  But this baby does my final polishing and does not get loaned out.

These are my impressions based on what I observed during the installation and using it for the past week.Installation - there are two brackets that hold the front fence rail to the saw. I have a Jet contractor's saw, and the brackets didn't line up with the pre-existing holes on the front of the saw. The brackets are about an inch closer together than the holes, which means one bracket slides on completely while the other is barely over the hole. Instead of boring out and tapping new holes, I went with that. Boring out and tapping would also have to be done too close to the existing hole. The back rail went on just fine, and the fence went together very easily. When I brought the fence right up to the blade to set the \"0\" mark on the indicator, I found that there wasn't enough play to adjust the indicator window to the \"0\" mark. Instead, I had to peel the measuring tape off the front rail and move it down about half an inch, after which I could zero out the fence.Performance - overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of the fence. It slides along the rails easily and locks down securely using the main locking mechanism. The fence is rock solid with very little deflection. One thing I would like to have seen are fence sides, either laminated MDF or UHMW. They include long wood screws for anyone who would like to add an auxiliary fence side.There are two locking mechanisms on the fence: The big main one and a smaller one for use with the micro-adjuster. The way you use the micro-adjuster is you lock the fence down with the small lever, then release the big lever. This frees you up to make micro adjustments to the fence position. When you have dialed in the correct distance, you then lock the big lever down and unlock the small lever. The micro-adjuster locking mechanism on mine slips very easily, however. When I lock the small lever down and start dialing, sometimes the fence stays put and the micro-adjuster moves. If I push the fence from side to side while the small lever is locked down, it moves with little effort. I am going to see if cleaning with mineral spirits and roughing up the locking cam with some sandpaper will fix this.Overall, I think this fence is pretty good. It's certainly better than the stock Jet Fence that came with my saw (bigger, beefier, and more solid).

I'd say I'm an decent intermediate woodworker and cabinet maker, not a pro by any means.  I'm in the middle of remodeling a kitchen and bathroom and will be making some new base cabinets among other things.  Stock fences have always been a problem for me so, I decided to take the plunge and buy the Vega fence.  I picked up a beautiful old Craftsman 10\" saw last year for $100 (model 113.29920, made in 1956 according to Sears).  You know, the ones with the nice heavy cast iron table and side extensions (they don't make 'em like that anymore).  So, this fence was more than double the price of my saw, and so far it's worth every penny!!It took me a couple of hours to set-up from the time I opened the box but that's no fault of the Vega fence.  I was proceeding very deliberately so as not to screw it up.  After removing the stock front fence rail, the Vega front tube brackets lined right up on the existing holes.  I only had to drill two 5/16\" holes in my table for the back fence mounting tube.  They definitely thought this design out and it shows.  Once you square the fence up to a miter slot, you crank down on four heavy socket head machine screws to secure the fence to the very solid head.  There's plenty of adjustments all around to fine tune the clearance above the bed (about 1/16\" seemed to work for me) and to get the scale zeroed out. When you have everything set and cranked down, I can't see things being able to move out of adjustment.  Every piece is very solid, the fence rides smoothly on the tubes and all adjustments are easily accessible.The unit arrived by UPS Ground and was very well packaged and protected in a heavy cardboard box, stapled securely and further protected with heavy cardboard spacers and 2x4 wood blocking inside the shipping box.  I agree that the instructions leave a lot to be desired.  But, it's a very logical set-up and not that hard to scope out.  If I can do it, I think most anybody with a reasonable degree of tool sense can do it just as well or better.  Love that it's made in the USA!All in all it was a fun afternoon and now my old saw makes dead-on cuts including ripping an 8' 2x4 just to see how things worked - right on the money the entire length.  The scale is pretty easy to fine-tune to a high degree of accuracy if you take your time.  The micro-adjustment is a very nice feature and works smoothly after a little break-in time (a little stiff at first but limbered up nicely after only a couple of uses).  I am very pleased with the sturdy construction and ease of use.  I hope this is helpful to anyone considering this fence.  I would buy it again and would recommend to a friend.  Now, to build some new table extensions and get started on those cabinets.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 23, 2012", "summary": "New life for an old saw"}

We had an existing Chamberlian in the garage, so I think that saved quite a lot of work.  This took my wife and I about 5 hours to install.  If we would have had to install from scratch, I would estimate it would have taken about twice that long.The drive is super quiet, much more quiet than our old one (which was about 10 years old).  Installation instructions were clear and reasonably easy to follow for the most part.  All parts fit together as described.  Overall this was a good upgrade from our old one.  Here are some pros/consPros:1. Ultra quiet and smooth belt operation2. The key access opener is a great feature and should come in handy when someone needs in the house that doesn't have a key3. Programming the opener is straight forward (finding the stopping point for the opening and closing of the garage).4. The motion detection for having the lights come on works wellCons:1. The belt drive is about 9\" shorter than our old opener.  Because of this, the garage door does not open all the way like our old one used to.  I don't know if that's just the way this one is supposed to work, but we lose about 7\" in the opening of our garage now.  Not an issue with the cars we have, but I was surprised by this when we were all done with the installation2. The belt sags a lot when opening the garage door.  At times, the belt can actually twist slightly sideways and get caught under the pulley drive at the end of the run.  It will eventually correct itself when the garage door is closed, but I wonder if this will eventually cause pre-mature wear on the belt because it is rubbing against things.  Maybe this is OK and part of the design, but as far as I can tell, we installed it correctly, and there are no adjustments than can be made to correct for this.  I guess time will tell here.3. So far I am unable to get the homelink function in my 2012 Subaru to connect to the opener.  I will keep trying, but I would not call this a deal breaker.Overall I like this opener and it's a nice upgrade from our old model.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 1, 2013", "summary": "Great quality opener with some nice features"}

The chrome part does not look like a cheap fixture; it has the look and feel of heavy highly polished chrome.  And the glass globes also look and feel very solid.  They do an excellent job of diffusing the light.  Rather than use thumbscrews the globes are attached with a large nut that screws around the bulb socket, so it is 100% secure and can't possibly work loose.  Although the manufacturer illustrates the globes as having their open end pointed downward, because of the way they are attached it is also possible to point the open end toward the wall (or even upward if you wish).  It gives the fixture an entirely different look while also completely hiding the bulb from view.  By the way, it uses two candelabra bulbs rather than standard bulbs.The rest of the fixture is pretty ordinary; the only thing worth noting is that high quality materials are used throughout.

The only problem is that when you are doing a job like trying to cut through a 3/4&quot; cedar wall to install an outlet box, it is hard to keep a perfect corner. I am not talking about keeping a perfect line, it is great for that, but when you are trying to cut an exact corner with a wide angled blade, it is hard to determine the edge. Consequently the edge of your cut can go a little wider than hoped for, leaving a tiny slit that can run out of the outside circumference of your edge lines.For making those kind of cuts the straight blades, without the angled sides makes for a perfect job. Knowing where the edge of the blade is, even while it is sinking into the wood is the key to getting your corners exact. With the 2 1/2 inch E cut blade, the tip is harder to get a bearing on where the vibrating edge is going to leave its mark. I'm not saying that you can't do the job with this blade, but for that type of application, the square rectangular blades make it easy to do a perfect job.I'm not knocking this 2 1/2 inch blade. As a matter of fact I like using it for covering a wide area. I can angle the face of the blade along a line, and as the back of the edge is sinking deep, the front edge is starting a new edge of the cut. All in all highly recommended.

Isenberg", "helpful": [3, 4], "unixReviewTime": 1360022400, "reviewText": "This comparative review is for:- Klein Tools RT200 GFCI Receptacle (Outlet) Tester- Gardner Bender GFI-3501 Outlet and GFCI Tester- Extech Instruments ET 10 GFCI Receptacle Tester- Triplett 9610 \"Plug-Bug 2\" GFCI Receptacle TesterOVERVIEW:-----------All 4 can be used to look for common faulty wiring in common U.S. household outlets and GFCI outlets, as well as test if GFCI functionality is operable, aka it will trip and cut things off when called on to do so.All except the Gardner Bender have the mini-LED for GFCI testing to confirm the test button made contact, though that alone shouldn't be a deal breaker I would think.All 4 work.Let's find a way to help choose one over the other.(1) INSTRUCTIONS:-------------------Klein's Instructions:The Klein's instructions are excellent, probably the best.  However, after reading the others instructions Klein's instructions could further benefit from much more detail on cautions/warnings/limits and useful commentary.- EASY-TO-READ details broken out by 2 USAGE SCENARIOS and done STEP-BY-STEP flow chart style.- MINI DATA SHEET spec info you normally don't expect, and some would argue need, from such a cheap tool.  I liked it's inclusion.- Printed on quality multiple page folded white cardboard pamphlet, certainly the nicest, most durable presentation, folks might actually keep it.  Its contents and its look belies a more PROFESSIONAL IMPRESSION of the product.- One negative is I think is the THINNESS OF THE CAUTIONS/WARNINGS as is obvious when you read the Triplett instructions (See below).Triplett instructions:- CAUTIONS/WARNINGS ARE THE MOST DETAILED, most useful.- The actual INSTRUCTIONS ARE THE WEAKEST and hardest to read of the three, almost no granularity or flow to the step by step.- The instructions and warnings were fitted into one side of a very thin sheet of paper the size of an index card.  SCREAMS CHEAP.  But again, the Cautions/Warnings are the best.Extech instructions:- The instructions are better than the Triplett's, though less detailed and usable than Klein's.- The Cautions/Warnings/Limits are perhaps tied with Klein's, though significantly less detailed and usable than Triplett's.- One-half of a cardboard backing the size of an index card is what you get for instructions and/or warnings.Gardner Bender instructions:- I like the separating of regular outlet and GFCI outlet testing instructions for the layman.- I like that there are some environmental engineering specs noted.- I like the list of what products like this don't do, the suggestions to use a qualified electrician to fix issues, the reminder to shut the power off to the outlet if you are going to work on it, and other safety advice.- The instructions are on glossy black&white; and show some care.  Not quite the attention to detail for instructions that Klein showed, but certainly adequate and quality enough not to detract from the product impression.If this is important to you, I give Klein, and in second place Gardner Bender, the edge here.(2) BUILD QUALITY, FIT & FINISH:--------------------------------The plug PRONGS for all of them don't wiggle, their ground prongs are fully formed, not the cheap looking u-style some have, and they all push into sockets easily.The CASES of all except the Gardner Bender are almost exactly alike except the Klein case appears better manufactured, next best manufactured was the Extech, and finally the Triplett.  The pieces fit together best and more flush with the Klein than the other two, there are less gaps between the plastic pieces and fewer surface imperfections.The Gardner Bender CASE is different than the others and its build quality is excellent, at least on par with the Klein, it looks the least cheap of the four.The Gardner Bender instructions announce that the unit is double insulated, \"the tester is protected throughout by double insulation or reinforced insulation\".  I don't know how this compares to the other three.I give the Gardner Bender and the Klein the edge here.(3) ON-METER LEGEND LEGIBILITY:---------------------------------The text describing the meaning of the LEDs is easiest to read on the Gardner Bender, Klein, and Extech.  The colored circles that match to the text are easiest to read on the Extech, next is the Triplett, then the Klein, then the Gardner Bender.  On none of them is the text or colored circles too difficult to make out, though the text on the Triplett is pretty bad.I give Exatech the edge here.(4) TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO READ INSTRUCTIONS:---------------------------------------------------The Gardner Bender says in easy to see white text on black, and Triplett says in big bold black text on white on the products to read instructions before using.  On the Klein and the Extech the same warning is near invisible molded into the case in the same color as the case.I give Gardner Bender and Triplett the edge here.SUMMARY:----------Overall I choose the Gardner Bender or Klein due to the quality of the instructions and a sense that someone cared more about their manufacture.They all appear to work and none of us are going to test a random sampling of 100 of them nor probably break them open to examine them, so we'll probably never be able to estimate their true comparative durability.If any of the manufacturers wish to comment here on having addressed any issues raised here I will adjust the review accordingly.TRIPLETT'S PUBLISHED \"CAUTIONS/WARNINGS\":---------------------------------------------To help users of all these kinds of outlet testers I've included here Triplett's good list of cautions/warnings as they may prove informative to the casual user of most of these type of outlet testers.- To help avoid erroneous readings, all appliances and equipment must be unplugged/disconnected from the circuit being tested.- Do not press the TEST button on (this meter) for more than 6 seconds.  Now this is interesting as pressing it for 7 seconds is one of the steps on the Klein Tools test instructions.  Note:  Does it go into why you shouldn't press it for 7 seconds?  Why of course not :).- This tester does not indicate the quality of a ground connection.- This tester may not indicate the presence of a hot wire.  That is, it is possible for a hot wire to be present when none of the indicators light.- This tester will not accurately indicate a combination of wiring problems.- This tester will not test GFCI's installed on 2 wire (non-grounded) electrical circuits.- This tester does not perform a comprehensive test.  It only checks for probable common improper wiring conditions.- 120 VAC is dangerous and may cause user injury of death.  Use all appropriate cautions.  Note:  Does it then go into appropriate cautions?  Why of course not :).- Use only on 110 to 125 VAC receptacles.- GFCI receptacle or GFCI branch circuit protector must be installed in accordance with the manufactures specifications.- All corrective action must be made by qualified electrician.  Note:  Amen.SOME ADDITIONAL EXTECH'S PUBLISHED\"CAUTIONS/WARNINGS\" THAT MAY APPLYTO YOUR MANUFACTURER'S UNIT (reworded):-------------------------------------------I'll add these additional ones from the Extech instructions.- If the circuit doesn't trip after hitting the GFCI button, either the GFCI is operable but the wiring is incorrect, or the wiring is correct and the GFCI is inoperable.- Tester will not indicate 2 hot wires in a circuit.- Tester will not indicate reversal of ground or neutral conductors.ADDITIONAL GARDNER BENDER PUBLISHED\"CAUTIONS/WARNINGS\" THAT MAY APPLYTO YOUR MANUFACTURER'S UNIT (reworded):-------------------------------------------I'll add this additional one from the Gardner Bender instructions.- The more the other appliances or equipment on the circuit are unplugged the less chance there is for an erroneous reading.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2013", "summary": "Review: Klein Tools RT200, Extech ET10, Triplett 9610, and Gardner Bender GFI-3501 GFCI Receptacle Outlet Testers"}

Whiteside", "helpful": [0, 0], "unixReviewTime": 1379635200, "reviewText": "I was in the market for a new compressor and wanted something that would be versatile for most applications, relatively quiet and had a decent reserve tank.  I compared all the various models in this class and finally settled on the MAC2400.  I'm glad I did.  I was a bit hesitant to order it from Amazon versus the big box store, but my unit arrived in perfect condition and I didn't even have to consider a return.  As usual, Amazon Prime insured it arrived quickly, saving me the trouble of having to go to the store.First, the unit is really simple to use and maintain...a little bit of oil, flip a switch and away you go. (I've yet to do an oil change, but that doesn't appear too difficult.)  It's ready to go after just a short time, so you don't have the long wait that larger compressors do.  The MAC2400 is not nearly as loud as most compressors this size, which is nice when you're working within an enclosed space.  (My friend's large PC is almost twice as loud!)  It's had the power to do everything I need so far - finish nailing, impact wrench drives, stapling, filling up vehicle tires and cleaning things off.  This unit probably doesn't have the capacity to run higher demand applications like sanders, paint sprayers and so forth, but I was aware of that and accepted the limitations.  While using it heavy and fast, I've noticed it does kick on a fair bit...but that doesn't bother me since it's not too loud and I expected as much with the portable size tank.  The size is just about perfect, too...easy to build a rolling cart for, complete with hose storage.  About the only thing I don't like, and this is true for virtually all compressors, is when you release the air tank...it's ear-bleeding loud...I don't even like to be in the same room.I've outfitted the unit and all my accessories with quick disconnects, which is practically a necessity.  I also hand-selected my accessories as opposed to getting a kit, I think that's a smart way to go.  (Most of the accessory kits are cheap and you'll end up replacing them anyway.)  Again, Amazon has a great selection here.Overall, I would recommend this compressor so long as you don't require a larger tank or the use of greater CFM tools.  (If you do, you shouldn't even be looking at this unit!)  But, for the common home compressor, this was a good buy at a great price.  I hope to see many years of service from this Makita!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 20, 2013", "summary": "Great Little Compressor"}

Why? you might ask?- light weight.- lockable in not only one, but two places.- secure, due to quality metal clasps, and multiple handles [side, and top] for transport. No noticeable sharp edges on metal parts, to cut, and/or scratch.  Side handles are spring loaded to stay in the close position when not being used.- usable minimum interior size for the \"Large\" carrier is : 18 1/4\"L x 9 1/2\" W x 10\" H [when the removable tray is removed]. Leave the tray in place, and the usable HEIGHT is reduced to 6\", in the lower portion of the case.- pressure relief valve.- very durable looking hinge, similar to a modified \"piano hinge\"Will add more later, if the use of this carrier justifies more info..UPDATE as of 11/30/12:For those of you who are interested primarily in the \"HIGHLY WATER RESISTANT\" & \"PRESSURE SEALED\" qualities....IT FAILED, MISERABLY!!There's a product defect that occurred during the molding process, and poor design QA \"quality assurance\". The raised lip on my \"LARGE\" box has a profound \"dip\" in it. It's on both sides of the lower half, and it's found directly above the side handles. If you run your thumb across them, you'll feel the dip. It's even more dramatic when you sight down the length of the raised edge, from front to rear...on both left, and right side of the box. When the lid is closed, the lip, at that low point, will not compress the yellow plastic gasket in the upper lid.How did I test it? I took a piece of writing paper, about an 1\" in width, and a few inches long, and placed it across the raised lip seal on the lower half of the box, directly above the side handles, so that part of the paper is hanging out, and the remainder, hanging inside............. closed the lid, and secured the metal clasps. Pulled the paper out, with absolutely no effort/no resistance, which proves that the raised lip was NOT contacting the upper yellow seal. Perform that same routine anywhere else on the box, and you cannot remove the paper without giving it a good hard pull......meaning that the seal is doing it's job.UPDATE AS OF 05/16/14: Here's an easier way to check it: You can just put a very bright flashlight inside [and try to aim it toward either one of the side seams], latch up the lid, put it in a dark room, and see if you can \"see the light\"!! I saw it in both cases...a large, and a small. Other than that, they're fine cases....just not water/pressure proof!So much for being water resistant, and pressure sealed. Other than those two highly touted qualities...... it's still a good tote box. Just don't expect to keep the contents dry in wet conditions. Of course, now it's a bit hard to swallow the price, since it's now in a lower grade class of case.HERES' A SUGGESTED \"FIX\"!: For anyone who already has this unit....I've worked out a \"fix\" for it. Just add about a 5\" long bed of silicone caulk at the base of the yellow gasket groove [BTW, the gasket is not glued in place, so it pulls out easily], directly opposite where the side handle supports are located. Gently push the gasket back in place, and allow about 1/16\" to 3/32 of an inch to be visible from the exterior side of the case. Normally, it would be recessed, and out of sight, viewed from the exterior side of the case. Needless to say, let the silicone cure for 2-3 days before closing the lid.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2012", "summary": "Reasonably well made, and waterproof as well.

The box was heavy cardboard but inside there was about no reinforcement to protect the tool. The only thing preventing total destruction  was the rugged design of the tool itself, which was mostly unharmed save  bunches of paint chipped off the handles and one wheel which was not only off the tool but the rim was seperated from the tire! Well it was a recon so the paint is no biggie but the wheel is inexcusable and not worth blaming on the shipper. Hey, did I mention I needed this thing for work? All the mechanics seemed good so I fired up for the break in and set about pounding and prying the miserable excuse for a wheel back to some semblence of function. The compresser itself has been a joy to use on the job and my only regret is I didn't do this a long time ago. However others have pointed out the pathetic wheels and packing going back far enough for the Makita folks to have straightened this out way before now.

They are cheap enough and most of us don't roll all that often so that maybe one should just throw them away after use.  In my case, I have a Wagner Power roller system that uses a \"custom\" roller.  On the outside, it looks like all other rollers.  On the inside, however, there are lots of little holes that feed paint from a core tube into the roller nap on the outside.  This system works very well and you never have to go back to a tray to \"re-load\" paint on the roller.  This roller cleaner is intended for other than my Wagner roller.  It basically forces high pressure water along the outside of the roller to quickly clean it.  In my case, I need the inside of the roller cleaned as well.  Knowing this in advance, I wasn't really sure that this product would be of value.  But, it did do a pretty quick and pretty thorough job on my Wagner roller!  The product quality was very good and it comes with an additional sleeve (which I didn't need) for smaller diameter rollers.  It also comes with a \"plug\" that you're supposed to insert into the back end of the roller.  I'm assuming that this plug prevents water from going into the center of the roller and thus reducing the pressure.  Since I wanted the interior of the roller to be cleaned as well, I didn't use the plug.  Summarizing, the price was good, the quality was good, and even though I wasn't cleaning a \"standard\" roller, I thought the result was good and faster than I have achieved manually.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2012", "summary": "Works Well for a Roller Not Intended"}

You need to know what a neutral wire is, and most light switches do not use one (but most light receptacles in modern homes have one).  Google the issue if you're considering buying any advanced light switch, and check your light switch wiring before purchase.Instead of accepting the wires like any old light switch (they normally screw in or clip in to even the cheapest light switches), this one has wires that extend out which you connect to your existing wiring with twist-on wire connectors.  This left a lot more loose wire than I had expected, but it all stuffed in the hole without a problem.It looks attractive, with a faint white light when off, and a green power icon when on.Then it was time to use my Android phone to control this device, and things went downhill.I downloaded the \"Wemo\" app, connected to the wifi network this device produced (which is totally unprotected and will grant access to your other wemo devices, such as a baby monitor, if you decide to get the full range of products).  I then entered my home wifi network and was told I had successfully set this thing up.And then nothing.When I went to the Wemo app or looked for a way to turn on the light from my phone, it acted like nothing was ever set up.  Worse, now the setup mode won't go forward with setup.  I never could figure out how to fix it.  I deleted everything and reset the switch many times, but was never able to get that 'successful setup' message again.  Then I saw the \"beta\" Wemo app (which is newer than the official one), and saw that one of its bullet points invites me to find the bugs in their software.Oh.  Belkin is still working out the bugs.  I tried the beta app.  It was the same as the official software for me.After several hours of trying, I have not been able to get this device to work via smartphone even a single time.  I tried two phones (both Android 4.00 and slightly higher).There are some other concerns that I have: this device will be broadcasting wifi the entire time it is in setup mode.  *UPDATE: it has stopped broadcasting the setup wifi when I checked about a week later.*  And after it's setup it will be connected to your wifi network.  So it uses much more power than a normal light switch (which technically doesn't use any).  So if you are \"Green\" or simply wish to keep the power bill down, you are probably better off with a normal light switch that doesn't itself use power.Also, the software is designed for an extensive ecosystem of \"home automation\" products, just like the software for my home automation thermostat (Trane) and door locks (Schlage) and cameras (another brand).  If you go all the way with this, it's going to mean a lot of software on your phone and a lot of switching around.  Trust me, as someone who has actually gone quite a ways with a lot of this stuff: it gets to be a hassle when they don't keep it simple.The software requires you to enter the program to operate the switch.  In my opinion, they should instead use a simple icon on my phone's screen that I hit once to turn on or off the light.  The icon would then change color to indicate on or off.  I would never enter an app environment.My impression of this software is that they shouldn't have put it on the market for Android in this condition.  (my review has attracted a very detailed criticism from an Apple user who had a completely different experience, so apple users are probably in luck).  A ton of other reviewers on Google Play have been unable to get setup to work, among a host of other problems.Update: I have been contacted by Belkin in the comments to this review, by email, and by phone.  They are polite and professional, but they are not native English speakers, the connection is usually very poor, and it was clear from their tips that we weren't going to succeed at troubleshooting.  After I asked these calls to stop they kept calling.  A lot.  My phone shows 29 calls and they will often call, go to voicemail, and then call again, over and over.  Not cool when you must leave your phone on 24/7 in case of emergency but you work a night shift.  Trust me.

All the way.I've added mine to a Delta Left-Tilt 10\" contractor 36-982.  There were a few minor problems on the install (nice tip on the extension roller). I pulled the left extension plate from my saw, replaced it with the Benchdog plate, and was then able to bolt the spare Delta left plate directly to the right side of the existing right extension plate. All of this takes up no additional space in my very small shop.  That all took about a hour, fiddling with the roller, moving the saw, working the bolts, leveling, etc., mostly due to the weight, plus a small fudge factor for operator ineptitude.Next I started to assemble the other parts including the miter gauge guide track.  In screwing the track to the plate, I found that either the  counter-sink holes for the screw heads had not been drilled deep enough, or they shipped screws with heads too high. In any case about 1/16 - 1/8 of an inch extended up into the track making it impossible to move the miter gauge bar in the track.  I called BD and they attempted to talk me into drilling the countersinks deeper, but for $329, I expect them to ship properly machined components.  I'll report back on how long it takes them to ship the replacement, and if it's any good.  Worst case, I have a drill press and the correct sized drill so I can fix it if necessary, but if I have to jury-rig an expensive tool to make it work properly I won't be happy.6/11 report back - BD shipped a properly machined replacement track (counter-sinks on original were not deep enough) immediately, and I had it in-hand inside a week.  It now all works just peachy.  I'm using my Biesemeyer rip fence, and my Delta and Kreg miter gauges.  Nice. I came away with the impression that BD maybe has five employees; but they seem to know machine tool work when they set their minds to it.  The customer service call went through Rockler, by the way.  They took the call at the 800 number and sent an email to BD about the problem.  The email was the only description that came with the new part.The additional plate on the right causes no instability, so I haven't added the support legs.  I had not installed the Delta right side wooden extension table, so now I have spare parts.  With the saw now weighing in at over 300 pounds I don't see much vibration.  The length of my table is now nearly 60 inches, and all of this took up not one inch more space in my shop.A truing block I use to check my saw table can identify no problems with the Benchdog table anywhere, and it looks like they may have read some of the posts here because the sharp edges on my table were already rounded.The phenolic plate is solid but not exceptional.  Okay for something like a PC 690 router, but not something heavier.I followed this purchase up with the Pro-Lift/PC 7518 router combo.  It's evident that somebody talked to somebody, because the only evidence I see that the saw, the table, the lift and the router weren't all intended to always be assembled together is the BD table is a different shade of grey, and even that's changing as it gets waxed, etc.  Seriously, the left-side Delta extension moves to the far right side with no modification; Delta even left pre-drilled and threaded holes to accommodate that change.  I had to add some new lock washers, but that was it. The weight of the router and lift on the left just about perfectly balances the extra plate on the right.  Vibration is trivial for either the saw or the router.I also added some double-sided tape and metal measuring tape which I setup to compensate for the width of the BD rip fence.  I backup that fence with my Biesemeyer rip fence.  I spent the time to do proper calibration of the two fences, and now use the line within the Biesemeyer width of cut gauge to determine the cut.  It takes me less than a minute to setup for a groove that is perfectly straight, and within less than 1/64\" of the desired distance from the rip edge.  It seems like half of the router-table books I own are dedicated to coming up with an accurate fence.  Mine's built-in, at a cost of two feet of tape from an old tape-measure.The fully depressed router doesn't even come close to interfering with the angle adjustment wheel for the saw blade.  The router fence barely comes close to touching the router when hanging under the table.  When extended  the router collet extends well above the top of the table for changing bits.  The only inconvenience is having to reach under the table and around the router to change the speed.I have to use space as efficiently as I can, and I can't imagine a more effective way to add a router table.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 4, 2008", "summary": "'nother five - results for Delta LT 10\" contractor"}

All together I bought four of these.The quality of the flashlight is outstanding. I have a LedLenser I bought here on Amazon for over $100 (P7) and the LED flashlight that comes with this kit is 90% as bright as the P7. And that's not just my opinion, that's using a light meter bought here on amazon as well. The light is a nice bright white and as has a useful range of about 1/8 mile (660') (reflective range about double that.) The one down side is one of the LED flashlights had a defective battery holder, which was promptly replaced. The flashlights have a beam adjustment for range; short and wide or long and narrow or anything in between. At the long range, the light pattern is a perfect square. As you pull it back, it goes out to a round spot and the further you pull it back it goes to a wide flood. The switch goes low-off-high-off-high flashing-off. The high flashing mode is insanely effective if you want people to see you.Now the bike mount. It functions well, but I did have to use some old vinyl 7/8\" tubing to act as a spacer on my 22mm handle bars. Its pretty easy to adjust and goes up and down and left and right. You may also notice it's \"sloppy.\" If so, you pull out the little rubber pad and there is a screw in there that you can tighten to take up the slack. I had to tighten all 4 I bought.Now here is the problem. I bought 4 total, 2 of which broke. The seller is replacing both. One broke in the mail and one just broke on it's own. It was fine after a ride and then the next day I came out and it had snapped during the night. The problem is the plastic hinges seem to be a bit brittle. They broke right were the metal pin goes through them. It's really very thinly molded in that area. Two are still hanging in there and we'll see how the two new ones do. I strongly suggest only tightening the nut just enough to keep the mount from turning.I put two on each bike. One is focused long range and the other wide range. You can easily be seen a mile away, and with the two of them like I have them setup, close stuff is visible and long range is also very well lit at least out to 1/8th mile.Based on the price, (I paid $25 each) I don't see how you can go wrong.

When I actually saw the old style (cast iron frame) 14\" band saws next to the Rikon Deluxe 14\" saw, it was immediately clear that this machine is in a separate class--there's no comparing the cast iron frame saws to this beast.  It's bigger, more refined, has as much power as the best of them, and has a huge resaw capacity (that exceeds the cast iron models with riser block installed).  When you start adding up the bit$ and piece$ required to bring a cast iron frame near the specs of this saw, you'll see that those saws aren't really cheaper.Set-up was no particular problem, but the manual for this saw is absurdly bad.  It would be a bad manual for a crummy, cheap saw, but it's an embarrassment to have such a horrible manual for such a nice machine.  Instructions are sparse.  Hardware does not match illustrations/descriptions (those few that there are).  In spite of this, if you are semi-mechanically inclined (as I hope you are if you're buying a band saw), you can figure it out.As one would hope, this is a powerful machine that cuts curves and resaws nicely.  The fence leaves something (a lot) to be desired--the machining on the fence is marginal, the mechanism to adjust the fence to square with the table is inadequate (and cheap)...but I don't use the fence much anyway.  This is a band saw, not a table saw.  I will likely build or buy a better resaw fence when I get into a project that calls for a significant amount of resawing...but the existing fence will do for now.  Like the manual, it is strange to have such a marginal fence on an otherwise impressive machine.In short, this is a great saw--the fit and finish is very good--and the shortcomings (manual and fence) are only minor annoyances.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2009", "summary": "Outclasses the old 14\" saws"}

Here are a few things that were a little different than what I would have expected (although I had a pretty good idea based on other reviews):1. These bulbs are tiny, this worked out just find for me, as my fixture was a little large for the space to begin with-- functionally it's not an issue, but they are likely smaller than the flood bulbs you're replacing.2. As others have noted there is a very slight blue hue-- I guess you could say it's a pretty cold light.  That said, it's a security flood for me, so this makes absolutely no difference.3. Some said these lights are not equivalent to 65w incandescent.  One thing to consider is that your original floods are very likely more than 65w, so check that out. That said, I'd agree that they aren't equivalent to a 65w incandescent.  They are a bit more directional, so I think where it's directed it's probably equivalent, but I don't think they cover the area of a traditional flood.So now that that's out of the way, I love these bulbs.  I bought 2, and so far I've had no problems with either of them.  They seem to have a very sturdy build, and I have no reason to believe they won't hold up to weather. My fixture has 2 bulbs to light a fairly small area (about 15' x 15'). I think they are entirely adequate, but if you're lighting a larger area, they might not be as satisfactory.I think the thing I'm most excited about is the 3-4w power consumption. I've been excited about the prospect of LED lighting to cut our energy consumption (yes, I believe in going green), but I've been disappointed to find that most new LED's use about as much electricity as a CFL.

I'm returning it and probably switching to another brand even though I've got the extra Pur filters.I almost forgot - the \"one click\" feature also doesn't work very well eitherl.

For that it works, sort of. First since I got an older version I've got the serrated blade. Still made from 154CM it's plenty sharp even though the blade looks like it's never seen a stone. The flat bits are ok, not great, but at least they are easily replaceable and as anyone who has used a Phillips tip driver knows, they wear out easily. And if you buy the extenderLeatherman 931009 Bit Driver Extensionyou can use any old 1/4th drive tip. I like that the blade is on the outside of the handle, and thus easy to get at. I like the liner lock. Normally I avoid liner locks as I find them weak and not dependable but this one seems up to at least the same level as the blade. (a thin but reasonable work blade.)What's nuts is the carbon spacer. I mean WTF? Who cares what that spacer is made of as long as it spaces, and doesn't rust. Secondly it looks like if Leatherman had thought it out better, they could have put two or maybe even three screwdriver bits in that space stretched out along the handle.Also the frame itself could have been one piece of bent steel instead of two on the blade side. Might be harder to manufacture, but Leatherman went to a lot of trouble to drill out every last bit of steel to lighten this thing, why isn't the frame just a \"S\" with the two slots, one for the blade and one for the pliers?Can anyone really justify the springs for the plier's heads? I have the original Leatherman and it didn't need a spring to lock in place the pliers. You don't need much friction to hold them in place, and all the force when using them, holds them in place anyway. Why complain, weight I guess and I'm assuming manufacturing cost which translates into our cost.As an EDC, it's too thick. When I hang the knife from it's clip in my jeans and then put my keys in the same pocket and try to reach past the knife, I'm always hanging up on the knife itself. My regular EDC is aSOG Specialty Knives & Tools TWI-22 Twitch XL - Black Handleand it's thin and smooth, so no hangups, scrapings etc. Weight wise it's light enough to not be noticeable.I have left the Phillips large tip in the bit holder because it makes the grip of the pliers smoother in my large hands. (XL glove). Putting the standard tip there digs into my hand if I apply any pressure to the pliers.The pliers are thin, but functional for that everyday task of pulling staples out of paper, bending a coat hanger to fetch that dropped thing in the sink, extracting bones from my fish after cleaning, etc. Leatherman & SOG have many other larger pliers options if you need a \"real\" set of pliers.On a positive note, the beer cap lifter is great. Works easily and everytime. Better than any of the other cap lifters on all the other multitools I own. The pocket clip is tight, but not too tight. Makes the tool easy to retrieve.After all this negative review you might think I'm getting rid of it, but I'm not. It does fit a function so I'll keep it.

I have extensively used a Delta 16-32 drum sander for a number of years and was able to sell it for nearly what I paid for it so the upgrade to a wider unit was financially feasable. I took a look at a lot of machines and read through a lot of the operators and parts manuals. This looked to be the most foolproof, reliable, easy to operate and should have a low operational cost.The machine came in three boxes and were very well packaged. The boxes contained the  sanding head, cabinet, and conveyor belt. Assembly is very easy. The sanding head goes on top of the cabinet and then the conveyor goes inside of the sanding head. The conveyor even features ceramic guides to help eliminate creep of the conveyor belt. I have yet to adjust the belt tracking. A standard 20 amp circuit is sufficient to operate the sander. No special wiring is needed.The smart sand feature works well on the machine. I can set the belt feed to 60 or more and the smart sand will slow the belt down when wider stock is fed through and back up when narrower stock is sanded. This feature has really made using this unit a real pleasure as I dont worry about stalling the motor, burning/gouging the stock, or ruining the sand paper. The key is don't take too much off during a pass.Turn the depth wheel 1/4 of a turn for the next pass or 1/8 turn for highly figured or unusually hard woods like locust or wenge. I usually check the temperature of the wood on exit and put it aside if it starts to get fairly warm. No scientific data but it does seem to help eliminate spotty burn marks especially around the occasional knot that may be present. these usually will hand sand out fairly easily but why not eliminate it from the start.Working with burl, birdeye and other highly figured woods sucepible to tearout on a planer/surfacer is very easy with this machine. It just takes a little more time to surface down these woods. Sanding surfacing makes it possible to make some very nice projects much easier.After using it to sand over 1000 bf of oak and walnut I have no concerns. I use 80 grit most of the time and then sand with a random orbit sander with 80 and then 120 and its ready for finish. On door panels I will sand the individual parts right after the dry fit so there are no cross grain scratches. Finish sand after glue up. I have also glued up and then sanded the whole panel. in this case its better if you drum sand to 120 before the finish sanding to hel get the cross grain sanding marks out. Also becareful (as one should anyway) when gluing up to assure the style is in plane with the rail. Sometimes the clamp can cause this problem if the jaws are not perfectly parallel on the clamp. But this machime can certainly sand it flat again should this happen.The inline stand seems a bit narrow especiallly given that the feed table overhangs it by a ways but it is not a stability issue. I dont mind the inline wheels as the machine is usually pulled straight out from its storage location for use and rolls straight back in when done.The optional feed tables should have come with the unit but it is possible that one would not need these if running stock of less than 3 or 4 feet long. It does take up more space. I would have liked to seen a design where the table was a set of arms with a roller that would flip up then one could feed stock with the roller arm up or down and flip them up for storage. When running wide stock say 40 inches like on a table top then give the stock some support on the edge that is not under the drum head. In/out feed rollers are recommended for stock 5-6 ft and longer.Dust collection is mandatory. And an ocassional cleaning of the paper is good too. Soft woods like pine dont do well as it clogs the paper rapidly. Hard woods like oak, walnut, et al work very well.Changing sand paper is easy. The handy tool they give you is still sitting in the package. I found that it was easy to change the paper with out it. Though my fingers are fairly thin, others may find it difficult to pull on the sandpaper clamp. The tool would be useful in these cases. Start on the outboard side and wind your way to the tensioner on the inboard (motor) side. I re-checked the sand paper tension after running a board after changing the sand paper and found it not necessary. The right hand side has a tensioner on the sndpaper clamp and it keeps the sandpaper taught. Only a little practice is necessary and changing sandpaper is easy.The sander came nearly perfect on the paralellism. It is easy to see that it could be a bit frustrating to set paralellism if needed but no more than say setting jointer or planer blades. In fact it should be a bit simpler as there is only the one drum to set. Careful snugging, checking, and then tightening of the bolts should eliminate any creep in the adjustment.I did notice a curious oddity when making a thin piece of veneer od about 1/16\" thick. The drum was making contact with \"something\" when lowering it down to the thickness of the veneer. It turned out that my dust collection system had enough suction that it was actually picking up the belt. The belt appeared to be tight enough and closing down the gate partially for the sander solved the problem. The sander doesn't need a large volume of air as the particulate size is rather small. Not often when things work too well that causes an unexpected negative consequence. I don't make veneers very often but this most certainly is one of those \"not in the book\" things you learn.In short this is a great machine.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2009", "summary": "Jet 22-44 Drum Sander w/ closed stand"}

I spend 8-10 hours over the period of a week assembling and aligning the saw.  If instructions were better and the riser block was right, it could be whittled down to 3 or 4.

You should either read the books with sections on band saw alignment, or get some help from someone who has, before assembling this saw.Wheels were round and faces were flat.

I started out using compact fluorescents (CFLs).  The newer ones work great, are cheap, and the color is pretty good.  However, I don't really like the looks of the CFL spiral tube in table and floor lamps, even though the shade usually covers them.  They are fine in lights with globes though.So, when LEDs started coming down in price, and they were making ones that looked like regular bulbs, I thought I'd give it a try.After I started out with a Cree 60W, 5000K bulb, I turned to the 2700K.  The 5000 was too &#34;harsh&#34; for indoor, and my wife almost gave up on them completely.Luckily, she let me pick up the 2700K, and liked the soft light it put out.  The come on instantly, unlike fluorescents, and I have not seen any flickering at all.  I get plenty of brightness - at least 60W equivalent (for about 10W).  Some peopel have mentioned a buzzing, but I have not noticed anything yet.  Then again, I don't have these lights on a dimmer.The bulbs work great in regular sockets, but they &#34;feel&#34; a little bit larger then traditional bulbs (that could just be my imagination).  They are certainly heavier and more solid.  The bulb itself is covered with a rubbery material that feels sticky, but I have not seen any dust accumulation on it after a few months in the socket.These bulbs should outlast me, so I have systematically replaced all of the table and floor lamp (anything that will move when I do) bulbs in the house.  No problems yet.A significant investment up front, but lower power bills and rare replacement costs.  If you are looking for a way to help the environment, safe power, and, eventually, money, try these out.

I added a Hitachi framing nailer, which is a bit air hungry, but the compressor supplied it adequately.The compressor is noisy -- high pitched and tinny with a bit of a ring to it when it shuts off, pretty unpleasant to listen to. But it's small and portable (and inexpensive), and that's the more important factor for consideration, right?However, after about 6 to 7 months in service, the air regulator failed and required service. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but the red adjustment knob felt as though it wasn't engaging anything internally, and I could no longer adjust pressure. It required service, and Bostitch directed me to a near-by service center, which unfortunately took a couple of months to return the unit to me. Any other compressor could have used an off-the-shelf regulator, but with all the molded plastic on this one, I think I was stuck with special parts.(It's not really pertinent to this review that I bought a different compressor, and gave the repaired Bostitch to my dad, who appreciates it though doesn't use it much.)The nailer and staplers that come with have been reliable performers, and as a combo kit, I'd still recommend this for moderate-duty use around the home with little hesitation, though for anyone earning a living off of these tools, a compressor with standard issue gauges, regulator and connector might be a safer choice if a repair is needed quickly.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2011", "summary": "Good kit for the price, despite the Compressor problem..."}

But I've been on my own-manless-for 20+ years so I'm handy w a screwdriver and all that huff.ASSEMBLY:This piece has wires you have to connect-snap. Done. But then you have to stuff it all up inside the base of the lampshaft--a bitch. Mine just would not go. It took several attempts to stuff it w/o getting one of the connectors blocking the teeny screwhole (which blocked the screw)or wires/pinch it when I tried to re-assemble to the base. So I layed it down horizontally again but rested the lamp head on a chair with a cushion, and tried yet again. See, the shaft thing just doesn't set DOWN far enough into the base to align the screw-holes. I tried 4x before I finally stood it up, wiggled and waved it around like a dancing fool until it seeded itself DOWN to where the shaft screw-hole and the base screw-hole aligned to actually be able to secure it with the iddy bitty screw.It only took 15 minutes but what a bitch! So I would advise dancing the thing to set the shaft to the base, unless yours fits well and slides easily--lucky you!LIGHT:A also bought it hoping it would do a good daylight over my drafting table, where purple looks brown at night and vise-versa. I do illustrating. It comes at my shoulders when standing up, so I guess that is ok height but would have been better higher. It would also have been nicer with a longer flexible portion to give it height that you could lower as needed. If you need one like that--look for a longer flexible shaft portion!The light itself is actually very nice. It has two settings: one high light and one dimmer. It illuminates what I'm looking at and I use my magnifier for intricate work that is closer to the work than this lamp could get. The battery powered little mag lamps are great for this in case you were wondering...I may take out the hokey plastic 'grill' over the bulbs to make it brighter. But I think any brighter light from this lamp might obscure colors or be too glaring too.So, summary:1. For 75.00 plus, I didn't expect plastic  grillwork over the bulbs and squishing wiring up inside it being so hard.2. The flexible portion is shorter than I'd like for ideal worklight in both standing and sitting positions.3. The shaft doesn't set into the base without disco dancin'.4.

We upgraded to the 3M Filtrete 2200 MPR Elite Allergen Reduction Filters and immediately noticed an improvement in our home air quality.We live in a non-smoking home with two indoor dogs. Our youngest son is the most sensitive to air quality. We change filters based on his sneezing, which can come on like an attack of the hiccups. We had used the3M Filtrete 1900 MPR Ultimate Allergen Reduction Filterfor years because it was the highest rated filter available for sale at the local home improvement stores.We found the3M Filtrete 2200 MPR Elite Allergen Reduction Filteron Amazon.com. They run about $4 higher per filter than the 3M Filtrete 1900 MPR. It would be fantastic if Amazon made these available through their Subscribe & Save program (hint, hint) but we have no other complaints. Amazon sells these filters in 6-packs, which is common among online filter sellers. However, I found Amazon's 6-pack price to be at least $15 cheaper than competitors' prices.Consumer Reports ranks the 3M Filtrete Allergen 2200 MPR the best Do-It-Yourself filter. It receives an excellent rating for dust/pollen removal, a good rating for smoke removal and a very good rating for airflow resistance. This high-performance filter also meets the American Lung Association of the Upper Midwest Health House Program's indoor air quality guidelines.According to the 3M website, the company \"developed the Microparticle Performance Rating (MPR) system to demonstrate a filter's ability to capture the smallest airborne particles--from 0.3 to 1 micron in size from the air passing through the filter. The MPR system helps you compare Filtrete filters based on the level of air filtration you want. The higher the MPR, the better the filter's ability to capture particles from the air as it passes through the filter.\"Rating: Five stars.MARCH 2012 UPDATE: Our family continues to use the 3M Filtrete Allergen 2200 MPR filters with great success. Unfortunately, Amazon has discontinued offering these filters through their Subscribe & Save program. In our community, you can't find filters with the 2200 MPR level and, if you do, they are more expensive than Amazon's everyday price. The one advantage is that you can buy one filter at a time instead of the six-packs offered by Amazon.

It definitely has its pros and cons, which aren't easy to discern from the product photo.___________________PROS:* The 27 watt compact fluorescent bulb (included) provides a cool light source and uses less energy than an incandescent bulb.* The hardware is very sturdy and well manufactured.  It's frustrating when parts aren't machined right and an item is hard to assemble.  This is very well built though.* The on/off switch is easy to reach and it's very large (probably an inch and a half long).* You can adjust the height up and down.  Just make sure you tighten the thumb-screw tightly, or else it will fall back down.___________________CONS:* The product photo makes the lamp look black, but it's actually a dark antique brown.  It's a nice finish, but make sure you're OK with brown.  If you're looking for black, you'll be disappointed.* It's hard to tell from the photo, but the arm of the lamp only goes up and down.  It doesn't articulate forwards or backwards.  (But yes, it features both up AND down!)* The photo doesn't show the power cord, but this is actually a big detraction.  If you look at the photo, you can tell that there are two pieces to the lam's arm.  The bottom piece screws into the base and is stationary.  The top piece supports the head of the lamp and has the power cord threaded through it.  If you look at the product photo, look at the bottom end of the top arm.  That's where the power cord comes out and dangles freely.  It's not pretty.* The lamp is only usable for a seated area (a desk or a reading chair).  The height only extends to about four feet.  If you need a taller light source, you'll have to put it on a stand.Conclusion:  Except for the ugly power cord, this is a handsome lamp.  It's a shame the photo isn't more detailed, because you really can't discern the classic style of the lamp from the picture.  The picture looks a lot more modern (and black), but it's not.

The idea is not a bad idea, just poorly implemented.  Despite reading several reviewers' reports that these clamps easily broke, I ordered them anyway since they looked like a solution to a common problem and I expected that the defect would have been fixed by now.  Wrong!  Without actually seeing the clamps, it may be hard to understand how they are made.  There is a polycarbonate \"base\" with two \"spring steel \"clamps\" attached via a separate polycarbonate \"lid\" which is screwed on.  The lid is not strong enough to hold the clamps leading to stressing (bending) of the lid and potential failure.  I did not actually use the clamps.  One clamp looked \"okay\" in that the polycarbonate lid was not obviously stressed and deformed.  The same was not true for the second clamp.  I'm sure it would have failed the first time I used it.  So, I returned the clamps to Amazon for credit which they did give.  For awhile, I thought about remaking the polycarbonate lid out of something more substantial, thicker, or stronger, like aluminum.  The lid is secured to the base via screws so this may have been possible.  But, why should I have to do this, especially when I really would have to buy three more sets to use on any four sided box?  At $10 per set, maybe I would have done this.  But not at $25 per set!  The manufacturing fix would have been at least to make the lid thicker.  I usually read most of the reviews with a grain of salt and discount some where I think maybe the user was at fault.  Here, I was at fault for not listening to other users.

Additionally, if the towel bar \"stuck out\" too far, it would interfere with a mirror.Since I have used a fair number of Moen towel bars, mirrors, and paper holders, I started looking on the Moen site for a towel bar, preferably one with two bars and 18 inches wide, and, to whatever extent possible, similar in design to the mirrors and light fixtures.  I found this towel bar and it fit all of my requirements except that it was too long.This was not a problem because I could always cut the two bars shorter.  It didn't appear that this model was available in a shorter length.  Looking at the specification, it was not exactly clear how far the towel bar \"stuck out\" from the wall so I called Moen.  They clarified things and this bar would easily work if I just cut it shorter.When I searched for it on the internet, not surprisingly, Amazon had it and at a good discount.

I own a lot of flashlights (torches to those Brits out there) but none of them are designed to wear.  My assessment is based on my inspection of the product and brief use.  Whether or not it will be durable and reliable in the future cannot be determined at this time.Bottom line:  I like it a lot.  There was one glaring problem with the light that I immediately discovered.  There were no instructions in the nice little box, only a multi-fold advertising sheet for other Coast products.  Maybe instructions were supposed to be included but were inadvertently overlooked, I can't say.  But a little basic information would have been helpful.  Such as what type of batteries are needed, how to operate the controls (on/off switch and focus).  It didn't take a lot of time for me to figure these things out but we live in the information age and I like information with products I use.The unit takes 3-AAA batteries that fit in the little battery pack at the rear of the headband.  You peel off the rubber cover to access them.  The lever at the top of the pack controls the power of the light.  On the light itself, the button at the top is the on/off switch and the knurled knob around the lens controls the flood/spot arrangement of the light.  Everything works well although all the controls are a little stiff.  They probably will loosen with use.  There is a small Velcro-closured pouch included with what looks like plastic clips inside.  I have no idea what these are for (another reason an information sheet is needed).  The elastic headband is adjustable and it fits snug when adjusted to the right length.The light works well, providing hands-free operation.  That's a big plus when you need a third hand or you're trying to work in a tight space.  For general nighttime use, I still like having a standard flashlight so you can shine light into the darkness around you and only have to move your eyes instead of your head.  But this is a handy tool that I like a lot.

For one the vibration is definitely less in this Bosch than the Festool, no question about that, and that is very important to me since I have developed severe carpal tunnel in both my hands, this is why I decided to try this new Bosch and I'm glad I did. I can sand off and on for an hour and barely notice it, If I use the Festool for an hour off and on I'll know about it and will have numb hands that will ache badly. Don't get me wrong the Festool is a fantastic sander and the best I ever used before I bought this, but I really like this much more after using both in my shop.. Also the ability to use a 5&#34; and a 6&#34; pad on the same sander is fantastic and a money saver. The dust collection on board (without a vac) is super, the dust collection canister uses an automotive style pleated filter that can be used over and over again, and it just works very well and is also very easy to empty.. Dust collection when using my Fein vac is a bit better than with the canister, but not by a huge amount, that's how good the onboard dust collection is. This sander is a bit large compared to other  sanders including the Festool but it's not cumbersome at all and fit's my hands perfectly. It's also feels like a very high quality tool and is built in Switzerland. As far as the finish it gives, it's effortless to achieve a nice smooth finish with no noticeable swirl marks if you use the correct grades of sandpaper and quality paper. I hate sanding as most woodworkers do but this makes the job a wee bit enjoyable.. I think it's a great deal considering all that's included and also considering the quality of the tool.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2013", "summary": "Best 5\"-6\" sander out there at present"}

It's great for keeping it still, but this sucker is a back killer to move around.This saw can't make a cut when placed at a 45 right miter and 45 left bevel - a tab sticking up from the left fence is too high and doesn't allow the saw to move.The laser is a tad narrow, and doesn't go a full 1/8\" for most blade kerfs.There's no detent override.It makes a mess with sawdust.  The collection port is really high, and the bag is angled downwards, so when it becomes over full it'll drop a big clump of dust if the saw is lowered when not running.The deck is 4-1/4\" high.  This is taller than some miter saw bench support brackets, and may become an issue.Side supports arms are not included, unlike most lower-end saws.Something that's a little silly is that unless the digital readout is turned on, the laser can't be turned on.  The readout resets itself to zero every time it's shut off and turned back on, so unless the saw is set back to 0's, the display will be incorrect, though it can be reset.Overall, it's the best saw for stationary work, unless you're a workout junkie and want something heavy to lug around instead of joining a gym.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2008", "summary": "Great saw"}

The outdoor button is water tight since it will be exposed to elements.The main unit operates on three AAA batteries (not included), the button unit operates on 12V 23A battery (included).  23A battery is one of the lesser common batteries, but it is available on AmazonEnergizer A23 Battery, 12 Volt - 2 PackI am attaching a collage of three photos, the first shows both units on a gridded mat for size reference.  The  second photo shows the back of the main unit with the battery cover taken off, and you can see the speaker and the mounting holes.  The third photo shows the HIPE wireless button next to the current wireless door bell.The size of the main unit is 3\" by 3 3/8\". It has screw holes but does not come with mounting hardware.  The button unit 1 3/4\" wide by 3\" wide and comes with sticky tape mounting, no screw holes.  This button is a bit wider than my current door bell, and is wider than the flat wood area near the door. (I am attaching a collage of three photos, and photo #3 shows this button near the current button for comparison, you can see that the lip of the storm door takes up some of the room needed for the button to fit).  My current door bell is mounted with screws, which I think is a better mounting method for an outdoor unit.The button unit battery is rated to last 1 year. When you have to change the battery you will need to pop the cover while it is mounted.  Care needs to be taken not to damage the blue gasket between two sides as it is this blue gasket that makes the unit water tight.The door bell sound can be selected from 48 musical tones and 16 cords.  The sound is fairy loud, the tunes vary from 50 to 80 db.  The sound however is not high quality, all musical tones sounded a bit hissy.The range of the receiver is pretty good, the box specifies range as 200 meters (656 feet).  I walked into the back of the yard and was able to ring the door bell while I was several hundred feet away.  That was pretty impressive.  This means this door bell can serve not only as a door bell for the main house but perhaps placed by the gate or next to the mail box which is not near the house.To summarize: The positive are excellent price, excellent range, good loudness. The negatives are I would have preferred screw mounting to the double sticky tape and a slimmer button unit. Note that if the button had screw mounting the thickness would not be an issue, as I would not need a flat area to mount the button.I received this door bell from the manufacture to share my experiences with it (positive and negative) with potential future buyers. I have no financial interest or business relationship with the manufacturer, and this review represents my independent opinion of the product.The photos referenced in the review can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo.Ali Julia review", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2013", "summary": "Excellent range, only sticky tape mount for outdoor button"}

For some reason or other, they stopped carrying the blue LED's about 2 years ago.  So when I happened to spot these on Amazon, I snapped up 5 of them.  And, I must say these are MUCH brighter than the blue ones I had originally purchased from the big name local retailer.  I much prefer blue light for several reasons.  Primarily, it doesn't disturb my eyes when I wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, and because it's lower than the head of my bed, the bright LED's are not shining into my face, so it doesn't disturb my sleep either.  In fact, I seem to actually sleep better than with the light I had in the same plug before.  (that light was one of those rotating color swirl LED bulbs that changed slowly from red, to green, to blue, with occasional lapses of almost no light - some might not like moving light on their ceiling, though it did not bother me, as I found it kind of restful as I was falling to sleep - that is, it was \"pretty\" and mesmerizing.)An interesting side note on this blue LED Waterfall light... (now, this is TOTALLY unscientific, so take this with a grain of salt, as they say).  We've had somewhat of a problem with tiny ants in the kitchen.  Since I put in the above blue LED light, I have not seen a single ant.  Usually, the ants are worse at night and in the early morning.  I've checked each night and in the morning, and not seen a single one (usually, I would see up to a dozen or more).  Is it possible that ants don't like certain wavelengths of light?  I have no clue as I've never seen or heard of any studies on such things.  Perhaps there are other reasons and this is a coincidence.

The tank pressure gauge is just behind it.The main panel has a working pressure gauge with a pressure adjustment knob next to it.  This regulates the pressure that reaches the hoses, not the tank pressure.  If you work at lower pressures, the unit will not cycle as often.  It is also handy to limit the pressure to safe levels for your various air tools.  The two quick connect hose couplers are located on this panel also.You do have to &quot;break it in&quot; before working with it; just open the drain valve and let it run for 15 minutes.

I wired my shop area with 12/3 to carry enough current for power tools.  The unit does not stay on too long when it cycles, so the noise is not really a problem.  It is not as loud as large upright compressors, but it does make a fair amount of noise, although not as much as I expected.It will keep up with nailers and other &quot;burst&quot; applications without cycling too often.  I use it with a Souix air sander and it does run longer when I am working.  I like to take a break every minute or so to clear dust anyway, so this is not a problem.

If you take on a tractor trailer, get a bigger compressor.Overall, this is an outstanding unit with few limitations for the average user.

I usually put the strap around my wrist when I slide into my sleeping bag--if I need to get up quickly during the night, the lamp is always available without requiring me to feel around on the tent floor or in the storage pouches.As noted by other reviewers, the plastic lens colors have changed.  There are now blue, red, and clear lenses. I've found the red one useful when I want to rummage through a pack when my tentmate has already turned in for the night. It gives you illumination that is not as harsh as the non-filtered white light (and it doesn't reset your night vision either).My only complaint has also been mentioned in other reviews--there is no place to store the other plastic lenses.  I keep the red one on all the time, and I stow the other two in the sheath for my multi-tool.  To me, getting the rubber cap and the wrist strap make this purchase worthwhile.

It's very basic!Pro's:- Works on 110-120V for sure!- Reads Wh use- Reads $/year on electricity usage- Reads CO2 output; value can be adjusted (depending if you know how much CO2 will be produced making the electricity you're using), and can be read in LBS or KG.- The wired display allows you to see the display even when plugging the base somewhere behind a closet's (or a difficult to reach) wall socketCons:- $/Year electricity use is just a calculator. One can set how much electricity 1kWh costs, and the device will be multiplying the value of Watts hr usage x price/kWh x 24hrs x 365 days, and display that value in $$/Yr.- The $$/kWh value only accepts one value, no day/night time calculations.- Display does not have back-light- The base of the device (that plugs in a wall socket) is quite wide. It covers more than 3 sockets in width.- Anything with a cable (headphones, laptop chargers, cellphone chargers) are prone to wear. I don't expect this device to last forever, but the cable makes it a lot weaker! As long as you're careful with the cable it'll last a long time.Other thoughts:Both the left button (world icon), and the middle button (Dollar sign), can be pressed long (+3 seconds) to customize some values. The left will allow you to change the CO2 usage from LBS to KG (by pressing left or right; confirm with center button), the middle will allow you to set the kWh price (de-/increase in steps of $0.01 / kWh); increasing using the right button, decreasing value using the left button, confirming using the center.The device uses ~0.5W by itself to power the display, or would cost you ~$0.5 per year plugging it in 24/7.It reads actual watts, can't read I over U phase shifts on AC.The device supposedly has a bar on the bottom showing when electricity is used, however unlike a mechanical watt meter, the bar won't blink faster when using more electricity. It's just has 10 pixels going on, one after the other when electricity is used; more like a thing for looks, not really to show accurate electricity use.Conclusion:For me, I don't care about the extra stuff that comes with it. I just wanted a Watt meter, and for that purpose it works just fine! I'm not fond of the wide base covering up multiple sockets, and the cable design. But I like the idea of a remote display.For the price, it's a good watt meter!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 24, 2012", "summary": "Very basic!"}

First of all I'd like to say that these bars aren't meant to be a nutritionally balanced, filling, enjoyable snack. They're designed to give someone in extreme conditions much needed calories so they can wait to be rescued or walk out of whatever emergency they are facing. Our own 72-hour bags contains Mainstay Emergency Food Bars, some mylar packets of drinking water, a small jar of peanut butter, some mylar packets of tuna, some beef jerky, a personal water purifier and other items. Since we may have to carry those packs on our backs for a long distance, how much it all weighs is important.  Mainstay bars are the most calories you can pack into a little packet.The bars themselves aren't bad. They taste like a dense lemon shortcake breakfast type bar. They're a little pasty, but totally edible. And if I'm hungry enough, they'll taste great.  They don't leave you feeling thirsty, which is also good in an emergency when water might be rationed. Each person's backpack should have one packet to see them through to their next hot meal. Because they're sealed in heavy mylar packaging, they will last for several years without spoiling, which adds to my peace of mind.Each 400 calorie portion (there are 9 in each packet) contains 400 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 46 grams of carbs, 69 grams of fat, vitamins A (16%), C (30%), D (16%), calcium (16%), and lesser amounts of niacin, iron, folic acid, magnesium and thiamine.If you really don't like these bars, try Datrex Emergency Food bars.

Finally it seems that someone had a person sitting at the design table who had actually spent time working with tools, and carrying toolbags.Evidence of this is in the PROS:-  Metal clips for the shoulder strap. They look better and will last longer no doubt.-  Padded bottom.  Eliminates the chance of damaging tools resting in the bottom of the bag when you throw other heavier tools on top of them.  It's very padded, more so than most.-  The pockets are well stitched.  They are not too loose, not too tight (a major complaint of mine with most every other bag I've owned).-  The larger pockets on the inside of either end appear to be made for a drill battery, or something of that size.  But, I've found they are perfect for a 30' tape measure or keeping plastic jars of small items like wire nuts or crimp on connectors in.  This is a major improvement because previously I was unable to fit those items in any kind of pocket at all and they frequently got damaged by the other metal tools.-  Looks great.  Not many others have this bag so it gets a lot of looks.-  The handles are not flimsy, they are sturdy, stiff reinforced handles.-  Wire reinforced top and base means it won't look like a dirty, wet bag of rocks in 6 months.CONS:FYI - I still gave it 5 stars because for the price of this bag the CONS are acceptable compared to the price (for under $30 they can't give you the world), and these things are secondary to the pros:-  Shoulder strap has a rubber piece on it to protect your shoulder.  It is too thin and slides all over the strap and rarely ends up on your shoulder.-  The bag is big enough in size that unless you store light objects the shoulder strap is not a good carrying option.  The handles are extra strong, but the strap seems extra light.-  Zipper could be better quality.  This is not a big deal to me personally because I keep it opened 99.9% of the time for easy access.  If you are in a harsh environment AND need to use the zipper often then weigh this CON heavily.Highly recommend.

This impact drill is awesome, as is the hammer drill.

I'm working on getting a replacement for that.  Also after about 2 years and 6 months one of the batteries from the kit went bad and no longer charges.  The batteries have a one year warranty so I can't get it replaced.So here is why I bought this kit.  I was looking to buy a replacement battery as I only have one left.

I like the idea of a single tool being utilized in two holders for both benchtop and portable work.  It's also great that you can choose board thickness by just by a simple adjustment without having to remove or add parts.Now, what I didn't care for was that the new benchtop system doesn't hold stock near as firmly as the K2000.  This is true because I still have a 2000 and I've tested it because I thought it was odd that I could rock the material in the new K3 system benchtop system.  The same stock (especially 1/2\" material) was rock solid in the K2000.  It's not enough to make the K3 unworkable, however it is enough that I noticed it right away.  I wrote Kreg and they admitted that it doesn't hold the stock as firm but feel the other benefits outweight it.  I'm glad I kept the old K2000 for benchtop work and use the K3 system like I did my old Rocket.  In looking at the system, it became obvious to me why it doesn't hold stock quite as well - there is no lower support for the board and the face of the jig is now a polished aluminum instead of the glass re-inforced plastic which provides more friction.  Additionally, the K2000 has a single ram which doesn't allow the clamp portion to move from side to side, where the K3 system does give a little.I'm not down on the new tool, however this is a review of my experience and it defeats the purpose if I don't call it like I see it.  If I had it to do again, I'd have remained perfectly happy with the K2000 and then just bought the K3 standard pack.Edit as of 03-10:  I stand by my review but will admit that I have used it a great deal - I simply hold narrow pieces with my left hand while drilling with my right.  I was at a woodworking show and a Kreg rep was there.  I posed the question as to why the jig does not hold material as solid and while they did admit that this is the case, my reasoning may be flawed.  He said that it is due to the \"spring\" built into the K3 that allows for small thicknesses of wood without having to readjust the clamp.  That makes sense to me, it's just too bad because the forward features of the jig such as that are certainly worthwhile, it just has this little side effect.

As for the complaints by some of the Mary's that have written reviews about excessive vibration I don't see it . It is  necessary  to always keep the saw base firmly against what you are cutting . Start your saw slowly and then bring your blade into what your cutting with lite pressure at first . Increasing the speed of the saw once you have established a straight cut . Running the saw too fast at first and or allowing the blade to bind up is what causes the vibration in any saw . In the right hands this saw is a pleasure to use and very effective . I'm surprised by just how smooth this saw is considering its size and weight . It doesn't vibrate nearly as much as  a full size saw when you hold it in one hand .  While I don't like seeing made in china stamped on the side clearly it's still milwaukee quality .

Need seems to figure in the performance of this heater. I woke up after a night of exceptionally cold temperatures for our area to discover that my well-fed home water system had frozen overnight and we had no water. The idea of sitting around holding a hair dryer on my pipes for who knows how long was not an attractive prospect, so instead I retrieved the heater and a full LP cylinder. Hooking it up was easy enough with the assistance of an adjustable wrench to ensure a tight connection on both ends with the hose. I double-checked the directions which were both printed on a small booklet attached to the unit, and printed on the side of the heater. There are many warnings to make sure the fan is running before starting it, so being sure to heed that I started it right up. While maintaining safe clearances I had the heater warm up the area where my well pump and pipes leading to the the house are located. The fan/blower was nice to maintain a directional heat right onto the frozen pipes. In no time at all the area and the pipes were warmed and the water system operational again.I've used smaller propane heaters in the past that lack blowing systems and are rated for way fewer BTU's - this heater was a whole different ballgame with the blower and a large tank. I'm impressed.  I did not do anything different this time except... I needed the heater and wasn't just testing it.  I know that makes no sense but I felt it only fair to revise the review.Mr. Heater Hero Forced Air Propane Heater 30,000-60,000 BTU/Hr. MH60CLPI probably shouldn't write reviews right after unsuccessfully testing a product.  Feeling is starting to come back to my fingers but it is slow.  I read manuals.  I read them multiple times with products I am unfamiliar with as opposed to computer related stuff where I have a high comfort factor.  Propane is flammable and not so good to breathe so I read this manual several times through before connecting anything.The connections were straight forward.  The admonishment to fully charge the battery was quite clear as well.  It looked pretty clear cut.  I charged the battery.  I connected the gas line to the tank and to the heater.  I turned on the fan which again you are cautioned to do, I did like all the cautions.  I let the fan run a bit and then I \"slowly, this is another admonishment, pushed the orange starter button down.  The heater ignited, I got startled and the heater went out.  I tried again and this time was prepared for the sudden noise.  I let go of the ignition button and the heater went off.  After several attempts with no ignition, I recalled that there was an interlock and if you hadn't gotten it started, turn it off, turn the fan off and redo the starting process.I did this multiple times to no avail.  As soon as I let up the ignition button the heater stopped.  I did read that you should hold the ignition button from 30 to 60 seconds after the heater ignites.  I brought out a clock to make sure that I was actually waiting the appropriate length of time.  Due to the garage door being open, the garage was very chilly and I thought that maybe I was rushing my 1001, 1002 etc count of seconds.  I timed the length of time I was holding the ignition button and 30,60 and 90 seconds made no difference.  As soon as I took my finger off the button the heater stopped.I reread the manual and could not discover anything I was doing that was not part of the appropriate start up procedure.  At this point I had little feeling left in my toes and hands and decided that I had tested this product as far as I was physically able to stand it.I can't imagine that the coldness of my propane or garage had an impact as this is a heater.  It is supposed to be used in cold conditions.  The manual does not recommend use below zero degrees but my garage was no colder than 31 degrees according to my thermometer.On a plus note, if you get one that runs, it is substantially quieter than the ones I dealt with back in my construction job days.  The noise when it ignites was similar but a lot less loud than I remember.  The unit seems nicely constructed.  The manual is detailed as to how to do your start up.  The size is great compared to the old ones I remember.  If I could have got it to stay running I probably would have loved it and gone 5 stars.  Since I (and admittedly I could have screwed something up) could not get it to continue running after thoroughly reading the manual, I can't recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2012", "summary": "Mr. Heater, Not So Hot, 2nd look Update!"}

But the instructions recommend this due to various factors.Since this device tests the battery under load, it should provide a more accurate test than simply using a voltmeter.There are a few issues though - albeit minor ones.First, the battery box is a bit difficult to open. Not a big deal, but it could have been a bit easier to open.Next, the instructions do not state to depress the button on the side of the unit to turn it on. And you cannot turn the tester off - it turns itself off after a minute or two of non-use.Lastly, the tester is a bit harder to use for left-handers because the negative test lead exits the right side of the battery, favoring the use of the right hand to hold the lead. Left-handers would naturally hold the lead in the left hand. When you do this, you have to almost turn the tester upside down and read the display at the bottom.It would have been better to have the lead coming out of the top or bottom so it would be easy to use with either hand.  Most folks would not notice this, but left-handed people (like me) immediately notice it.I still gave the tester 5 stars as all of these things are minor, and I like that it is made in the USA.

I took the stabilizer (little shock absorber) off and tested it.  Sure enough it had failed.  I could easily extend and compact the shock arm with ease. Since this part keeps the handle and therefore the hollow chisel from slamming down on your work it is a very important piece of the machine.  I can still use the mortiser but I have to make sure to constantly keep my right hand on the handle which makes it difficult to work with the material being mortised.  I am currently looking for a replacement part but so far have had no luck. I suppose some authorized service station exists out there that carries a replacement for this part but I haven't found one yet.  Other than this inconvienience I think the Delta mortiser is a pretty darn good device.  It appears that the Stabilizer has a short shelf life in that it tends to deteriorate over time whether its used or not.  It worked good fresh out of the box but didn't stand the test of time ( a couple of years)  There was no mention of preventative maintenance required for the mortiser in the Delta user manual.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2005", "summary": "Part Failure"}

The knife uses a frame lock &#8211; a piece of metal that prevents the blade from closing.  However, while the lock did engage on my knife, only about half of the thickness of the locking piece did so.  When engaged it did lock the knife blade, but I worry about it slipping, enabling the blade to close on my fingers. I was able to open the knife one handed, but the lock only engaged when the blade is opened with some force, making it imperative to make sure that the lock is engaged before using the knife.I am a fan of coast flashlights and they are my go-to lights that I use in preference to all the others that I own.  I was therefore surprised to see a coast product that was not assembled with the care that I have come to expect from their products.  Ordinarily, a possibly defective safety feature would be enough for a one-star rating, however, many pocket knives do not even have any sort of lock, and that while I fear that the lock might slip it has not yet so, so I am giving the knife 3-stars, with the very strong caveat that one use it only with very great care.  The lock on other knives may be OK and if it were, in view of the price, I would have given the knife four stars.  All that would have been required for the lock to fully engage was a little grinding on locking piece, and this may be the case for other knives, but not mine.  This looks like a case of poor quality control, which is not surprising for a knife sold at this price, but is for one bearing the Coast name.The finish of the knife was OK, but as others have remarked, one of the screws holding the wooden inserts was raised a bit instead of being recessed along with the others, which is another example of poor quality control.

One drawback is that the water pressure is pretty low when getting the filtered water, but then my original water pressure is only 40 PSI and that could be the reason.  Also, having the filter system installed has not reduced the water pressure when using the faucet, which is good news.  One nice feature of this system is that you can remove one filter at a time (has 3 filters) without having to shut off the water.

First, this will only work if your plumbing is tucked away inside an INSIDE wall.  Because there is no heater, you need the warmth of the house to keep the water room temp.  If your plumbing is in an OUTSIDE wall (window wall), the plumbing will not stay warm enough to use the bidet in Dec-Mar if you live north of S Carolina.  Second, the plastic piping that connects the bidet device to the house plumbing is difficult to attach to the little nozzles at the connection point.  STRONGLY advise that you attach the white plastic piping to the main bidet piece BEFORE you install.  Once in place, it will be very awkward to reach and it requires a lot of hand strength to attach it correctly (wait for a non-damp, low arthritis day).  Third, the plastic piece that screws on directly to the bottom of the toilet tank is not well designed.  The screw-on bolt DOES NOT rotate independent of the rest of the little piece. That matters because once you tighten it into place you will have to attach the other end of the white piping to the little nozzle on it.  That nozzle may be facing away from you once the piece if fully tightened and it can be tough to attach things at an awkward angle.  Solution: ALMOST tighten the plastic part that attaches to the toilet tank;  rotate toward you so you can affix the white piping, THEN fully tighten the screw-on bolt to the bottom of the toilet tank.  Having said all that, it's not really so tough.  The directions stink, though, so you need to have a good idea of how it will work before you begin.  It's pretty logical.  Apply the above tips and you should be home free.  To test: put plastic wrap over the seat and turn it on.  You should see a strong stream of water hitting the plastic wrap.  Do I really need the plastic wrap to test?  LOL, yes.  Or you will be soaked from the stream of water.  Final note: if you have an old house and no one has done any plumbing adjustments for quite some time you will need WD40 to loosen the existing screw connections if you do not wish to strain yourself or damage the existing lines.  Just spray on the treads, wait 2 minutes and slowly turn.  I wasted well over an hour discovering these tips and making a foolish mistake.  I hope these tips help others do the job quickly and happily.  BTW, once you have the old toilet seat off, it might be a good time to replace it.  My folks had an old, heavy wood seat.  I got a new plastic, soft close seat and lid and they are happy about that.  Just make sure you buy ROUND or OVAL (elongated) to match what is there already or it won't fit right.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2013", "summary": "Amazing bargain; no electricity; minor probs to solve (solutions listed here)"}

The readout unit installed on the left side of the fence locking mechanism with only one drilled hole (which Wixey even supplies the drill and screw for, a really nice touch since drill size and self-tapping screw size is a critical combination for a trouble free self-threading)). I had a bit of trouble, however, setting up the system, as the readout unit needed a bit of adjustment to get it to slide onto one of the two pieces of track that fit end-to-end. At first I couldn't see how it could slide on one piece and then bind up a bit on the other one since the two tracks were within 5 thousandths of one another in the part that the readout slides on. But the directions say \"loosen the screws on the back of the readout\" until the unit slides freely but without any slop. What the directions didn't tell me was that I needed to actually [carefully] pry the unit apart slightly to get that screw loosening to do anything. I was a bit paranoid to go prying apart an electronic device for fear of breaking it and having a bigger problem on my hands. So, I contacted Wixey and got the skinny on how the readout unit fits together (in one day by email - pretty darn good customer service - and from a guy named \"Wixey.\" That sounded good to me!). At his direction I pried it apart slightly to get it to loosen up just a bit, re-tightened the screws a little bit and then did that a couple of times to achieve the required free-sliding, but not binding condition. After that little hick-up it works like my planer readout - perfectly and repeatably. Wixey is the way to go if you want dead-accurate and repeatable results. I've got some other brand digital readout devices and not all of them \"keep their brain\" and must be re-calibrated periodically (or in the case of some brands - must be constantly re-calibrated). I have not had to re-calibrate the planer readout at all since setting it up (which was easy), and it is dead on every time. By \"dead-on\" I mean within a hundredth of a millimeter compared to digital calipers using a spiral planer cutter head on perfectly set-up planer in-feed/out-feed and bed rollers .002 above bed). I love that! So far in the two days of use, cutting some pretty expensive 10 quarter Walnut it has produced (with a properly set-up Vega fence)some cuts that are the same on the readout as with digital calipers. Sweet. If it were a perfect world this readout would have 2 AAA batteries in it like the remote planer readout rather than a big button battery. Remembering to turn it off rather than waiting for it to turn itself off should extend battery life until that little caveat is addressed in the next iteration. I wouldn't wait just for that to buy it now though. I wish someone had made this thing 25 years ago. I wonder how much time I've spent collectively just setting my fence with a tape measure over the years...  Get it now. You won't be sorry.UPDATE: After several projects including a walnut and cherry double chest of drawers I am glad to say the Wixey gauge is still dead on. I only had to recalibrate it once when I re-calibrated the parallel of blade to table slot. The Wixey makes fast, accurate and repeatable cuts. I don't even check the results much any more (after about 200 times because of paranoia)since they are always right.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2012", "summary": "Dead accurate"}

The energy savings are excellent and the LED science has improved so much that we're gradually changing out much of our interior and exterior lighting from incandescent to LED.And now this Brightech LED floor lamp has surprised me with the amount of light it offers.  Rather than the diffused, warmer light of an incandescent, the LED lamp provides a directional cool and very bright light.  If, for some reason, you choose to adjust the arm of the lamp to close body proximity, you'll be amazed to find how little heat it puts out -- unlike an incandescent or especially a halogen bulb does.  The on/off function is via a thin toggle switch behind the actual lamp head.The floor lamp has a sleek, modern look with a brushed silver finish.  It's highly adjustable and moves smoothly to each new adjustment.  It has a limited swivel at the base of the adjustable arm and that arm then extends/retracts easily.  The lamp portion itself will rotate easily to find your perfect position.  It's height varies, of course, depending on the degree of articulation you've chosen -- but its size works great as lighting behind or beside a chair/sofa or extending over a desk.  The actual lamp head is somewhat small at about 5.5-inches diameter at the widest point of the flared opening and about 4-inches in depth.The lamp arrives in double boxing.  It is SO simple to assemble, that you'll find it will take you longer to extract it from its ample packaging than it does to put it together.  There is a small one-sided sheet of mostly illustrated instructions.  While the instructions are not very detailed, I'd have to say that you don't *really* need them.  It becomes obvious pretty quickly how the three components fit together.The heavy base will give you an upper body workout (or maybe I'm just a weenie).  It weighs nearly 12 pounds which helps it to stay put where you decide to place it on the floor.  The ends of the middle piece are shaped differently so it's readily apparent which end attaches to the base.  Included with the lamp is an allen wrench with two differently-sized ends for tightening the appropriate screws at the base (the larger screws) and to secure the adjustable arm to the middle pipe section (smaller screws).  Probably not a bad idea to hang onto the allen wrench in case you need to re-tighten the assembly screws or the adjustable arm screws at any point.The cord is nearly 9 foot long and can be tucked into a channel that runs the length of the lower pipe section.  There is a section near the AC power supply where you can separate the cord via a connector in case you need to thread the cord through a small opening that would otherwise not accommodate the size of the larger AC power supply (perhaps office furniture or hidden electrical outlets).The bulb in this lamp is not replaceable; however, its expected life is about 20 years.  I can DEFINITELY learn to love the idea of never buying and changing out light bulbs for 20 years.Sample provided for review.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2014", "summary": "4.5 Stars -- Bright white light in a very adjustable floor lamp"}

The entire purpose of this paint is to draw attention. I feel better now driving through intersections with a car without doors when I know that everyone who is remotely paying attention will see a bright white bar under my car. Great nightime safety addition that looks good in the day as well.As a note - the instructions really need to be followed EXACTLY.

I got this tool hoping it would help with a series of wood and tile floors I'm planing on installing in a couple of weeks. My house is old and I know that the current floors are an uneven mess, so I'm sure they'll be even worse when we strip off the existing tile.I agree with the other reviewer that the level measurement plate (the white board that shows you how uneven your floor is) is kind of a pain to use. However, once I figured out what I was supposed to be doing and got comfortable with the remote, I found it to be a simple and adequate way to test deviation. It is very important that the unit be sitting on a totally flat spot when you shoot the laser. Anything more than 4 degrees off and you will need to move the unit (because it won't self-level, a function the level attempts to perform when you turn it on).Of course my floors are old and shockingly un-level, so it wasn't difficult to see the discrepancies on the level measurement plate for the preexisting flooring. In a couple of weeks my construction pro will show up, rip off the old floor and be able to use the tool on the sub-floor that will most likely need pre-flooring prep. Although he has been a general contractor for almost 25 years he has never used this kind of level and is very interested to try it out.This is obviously a very specialized level and one I would think was indispensable for somebody in the flooring trades. The level is very easy to set up and comes with batteries if you don't already have a Bosch rechargeable battery. Like the other Bosch tools I own this level is extremely well-made and substantial.  The use and set-up  manual was very easy to follow, and it probably took me about an hour of farting around to finally figure out the best way to operate it.People might consider this a dumb point, but I'd like to say how much I like the toolbox the level comes in. Unlike every other power tool I've ever bought, this box is roomy and doesn't require a degree in origami to get the tool back into the case after you've finished using it.

I initially bought them because a house we were remodeling had some issues with the floor drain backing up.  They worked so well that I ended up scattering them about the house, positioning them on the floor near all water sources.  My husband had installed new plumbing throughout the house, and apparently one type of PVC fitting we had used was faulty.  The alarm alerted us to a water leak that could have caused tons of damage to our newly installed drywall.  We had used these same plumbing fittings throughout the house, and two more eventually failed as well.  Fortunately the alarms alerted us to these water leaks.We have placed these underneath all of our sinks and beside our water heater and washing machine.  I bought some of these for my son's house, and they have alerted him to an overflowing laundry sink, a copper pipe that had corroded and sprung a leak, and a sump pump that had quit working.This is such a simple product.  There are two metal connectors beside each other.  When water comes in contact with these connectors, they sound an alarm.  To turn it off, just dry off the connectors.  My daughter did have a problem on occasion with the humidity on her basement floor setting the alarm off.  She now places those on either a thin piece of cardboard or a piece of fabric.  The water still reaches the alarm, but the humid concrete floor doesn't set the alarm off needlessly.I'm really amazed that more people don't use these alarms.

Other hams agreed, it's versatile and perfect for so many uses!  Did I mention how the guys kept playing with the capacitive touch, blinking the light in morse code style?!So.. shhh... one of the ladies said she's going to get this lamp for her father for a unique gift.

The directions for the clamp and wide jaw show you how.I have three sizes, and occasionally I set two parallel to each other to rout a perfect groove.  With the router guided on both sides, it is impossible to mess up the cut!Good stuff.  The low profile of the guide also helps.

As always, you'll get the best price here. True, it isn't as big as many of the other ones, but you may not need one that big. I used this because I love Dove soap, but as anyone who has kept any type of soap with a good amount (as compared to other soaps) of lotion in it on those built in shower soap caddies...it get's mushy and mushy fast. And when it isn't getting mushy, you end up playing foot hockey with the thing when it slides off said built-in shower caddy. No more. I installed this thing with ease, and now all our shower condiments, or whatever you call them, are out of the way. I tested the strength of the caddy by putting a decent amount of downward pressure and they seem to be pretty sturdy. They even give you an extra set of adhesive for when you end up moving it later on down the road, or if you just messed up the first time around trying to install it. There are also general replacement adhesives at any moderately-sized grocery or warehouse stores in cased you messed up twice or you fantsy moving apartments often. It's not shown in the product pic, but there's actually a little hook with two prongs on the end that you can hook your back brushes (or whatever else) onto. You just insert the non-pronged side sideways into the little slits you see on the caddy and then turn it flat so it \"attaches\" onto the caddy. If you're having trouble visualizing the size of the caddy and whether you can accommodate your shower condiments (I'll figure it out, eventually), you can fit a decent-sized (meaning non-Costco) shampoo/conditioner bottle and a bar of soap on each end, and a bar of soap right in the middle. You might be testing the strips this way in the long haul though. Overall, this is a great buy that solved more than one problem for me.

Failure rates on last years purchases are running around 30%-40% with less than 12 months (2000 hours)of use. Quality control has dropped WAY DOWN! I will not be buying these ANYMORE. It has cost my company hundreds of dollars in lost hours to warrant (replace for free) faulty bulbs for last years' clients. This is crazy! I should have paid double it would have saved me a fortune. What a huge mistake! If these are for your personal property, it is an okay purchase. But do not place these bulbs ANYWHERE that would be inconvenient to fix/replace. Also, bulbs will turn from warm white to cool white after about 18 months of use. It is as if the manufacture used yellow marker to tint the LEDs and it starts to 'wear off/fade' causing the lights to lose their warm white color. Unacceptable! I have purchased over a thousand of these and I expect it to haunt my company for a long time. Sorry I purchased these. I left my previous reviews/updates for all that care to see what i previously wrote. Torchstar also only warrants these for 12 months for original purchase time. The packaging states they are rated for 20,000 hours, Which translates into 4.5 years for 10 hours of use per day. They also state bulbs are for indoor use only! Latest batches are not lasting 6 months!Update 8/20/2013I have increase my rating from 4 stars to 5 (Should be 4.5 Stars) because Torchstar has really improved their shipping speeds. Failure rate is less than 2% which is very acceptable.Torchstar has FINALLY hit it out the park with fast shipping now. I have bought several batches lately with each with at least 30 bulbs per order and have been getting them with 2nd day delivery from CA to Charlotte, NC in two days!!! Well done TORCHSTAR! Keep up the good service!Review update on 3/10/2013Torchstar is STILL having a problem with reliable shipping times... my previous order came in less than 5 business days. That is Okay! NOW...The current order is going on over a week, and still nothing. I see the post office has JUST received the shipment. Not happy about that... Post office DOES mark when they actually receive the product, so why are you waiting SO LONG to ship out from your store? Yall need to take note from Amazon and ship orders out the same DAY. If you do not have it in stock, do not try to sell them!Let me just say I have ordered several \"hundred\" of these MR16 LED bulbs so far... (I am a lighting installer contractor) they seem to have excellent quality. I have found only about three bulbs out of the couple hundred that I ordered with the PIN problem, But I have figured out how to unscrew the bulb apart to 'fix' the problem. The light output is VERY good, I would say it is easily over that of a 35 watt bulb and very close to a 50 watt. *** Please note *** that I have found the wattage of these bulbs to be off. This may play into your transformer and wire size calculations. These bulbs have an intial start-up wattage draw of around 6 watts each (10.5 volts at fixture with 0.57 amp draw=5.98 watts) , and then slowly drop down to around 4.5-5 watts each after about 15 minutes. On one clients property they had a 120 watt transformer with 20 fixtures on it that should have been drawing about 80 watts of power plus the wire friction loss of about 10 watts. It was drawing around 120-130 watts on initial start-up and causing and 'error' shut-down . I ended up upping my transformer size to 200 watts to stop the over-load problem. All-and-all these are GREAT BULBS and I will continue to buy these. They did ship to North Carolina from California via Priority Mail. Though it did take over four business days to get to me... I think that was mostly due to the handling/post-marking than the post-office. I think if you buy these you will be happy like me.Update 1/17/2013: I have found that I have had about 7 of these bulbs fail. I think they have about about a 10% failure rate at most. Still not bad for this new technology. And at this extremely affordable cost they are still worth buying extras just in case. My last shipment took over TWO WEEKS to receive. This was on Torchstars part too. I only like to wait about no MORE than five business days from the order day.Note, the color is pretty good. Note, as Halogen bulbs get brighter, they get whiter too.

It does offer more protection than a zip-able sandwich baggie and it does have some features that make it worthwhile.First, the case itself is reasonably well-made.  It won't stand up to bear bites or hydraulic presses, but it keeps your headlamp tidy and free from all that would poke, scratch, scuff, or otherwise damage your light as it's living in your pack.  It is made out of the same semi-rigid material as cases for portable hard drives and should easily protect your headlamp from falls on hard surfaces.  (providing the light is in the case and not on your noggin)Secondly, it has some useful features.  There is a tiny pouch inside that accommodates your AAA batteries.  This is great not only for storing the batteries when you put your headlamp away for a bit, but also to keep a set of spares when your headlamp is in use.  There is also a tough, wide nylon strap on the back of the case that works really well for lashing the case to the outside of your pack or for wearing on your belt.  I have found that it is actually wide enough to be useful, too, a detail I appreciate.  The clamshell design of the case has webbing near the hinge so that if you open the case while you are wearing it on your hip, it won't just fall open, dropping the contents on the ground, or into the crevasse - Another nice touch that shows some thought went into the design.  The zipper works well and smoothly and the small pull is covered by textured rubber, making it easy to grasp by gloved or cold hands.So, while I have lots of good to say about this little case and have been impressed with its design and quality, I've got to ding it one star for the price.

Warning: this light will not survive a drop of 4-5 feet on to a wooden floor.)Given the light's cost last December, I now wish I had purchased two at that time?  Is now the time to purchase two?  Perhaps so, but on 2nd thought I wouldn't base the decision on cost.  As the economists keep saying, world-wide inflation isn't something to fear: it's inevitable and something to be expected.  Based on such logic, purchasing two on the basis of a \"good price\" would betray fear and pessimism \"going forward\" (economic jargon for \"in the future\").

I was thinking a remote control was a positive because you could lie in bed and adjust your fan speed and light, but it's a bit confusing to turn the light on/off when you come into the room if you're also planning to use this as a primary light source for a room. For example, if the button on the control is on, the light switch works for both on/off. If the button is off, the switch doesn't work when you walk into the room.

I'm a Certified Dog Trainer, Vet Tech & a Dog Groomer.  The concept of the Pedi-Paws is a great one & made perfect sense to me.  Problem was, it is just not powerful enough, even for my small Jack Russell \"Terrorists\".  I was really bummed out about it too.Then one day my Dad came home from a local hardware/home improvement store with this product!  BEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD for me!!  It works WONDERFULLY on dogs nails!It's powerful enough to do the job quickly without putting the dog thru the torture of holding them there while these inferior (my opinion, again) products that don't have strong enough motors to do the job quickly & well.I have 2 Jack Russell \"Terrorists\", one HATES having her feet handled & the other, who's been very fearful of anything new since she was 12 weeks old. After introducing them to the Dremel I mentioned, my JRT who hates to have her feet handled, will now let me use the dremel I have to do her nails, (she still doesn't like it, but she now lays still & lets me get it done.) If I get the old fashioned nail clippers out, she runs for the hills. My other, fearful JRT loves it!Once she got used to it, she now lays on her back & actually falls asleep while I'm grinding away at her nails!The model I bought, came with a carry case too. I love it, because I can also keep combes, hemostats & lots of other \"doggie\" items in it.It's become my \"Doggie Doctor Bag\"! I got my Dremel at a local hardware/home improvement store & it's much cheaper than the \"Pet Grooming\" Dremels I've seen here. Because it comes with lots of extras, especially the case, which is worth it's weight in gold!I was looking for a replacement battery for my Dremel & saw all the other Doggie Nail Grooming products & just had to let all of you folks know that you can save money & get a BETTER model Dremel or about the same & sometimes, LESS money than the inferior ones that are just packaged differently to draw in pet owners! They get the job done better, much quicker with a faster RPM that won't bog down & most dogs will happily tolerate, because it takes less time!!What I did to get my dogs used to these, was (BEING PATIENT WITHOUT GETTING ANGRY IS THE KEY HERE FOR SUCCESS FOLKS!1. When I first brought it home, I attached the battery & set it on the floor, to let the dogs \"approach & retreat\" at their own pace. Dogs always use this method when they are unsure. They will approach something new & then retreat, checking to see if it's safe.After the first couple times of approaching it & they actually started to sniff it, I used a clicker, but you can also say \"Good Dog\" AS THEY ARE SNIFFING IT! (Timing is SO IMPORTANT) then treat them. Do this as many times as you need to, until they get more comfortable & get to the point that no matter WHERE you set it on the floor (put it in a different room on the floor, so they will get used to it in different rooms. Dogs don't generalize well.) Do this until they get to where it doesn't seem to be such a \"weird\" thing to them when they see it. You'll know when, they will start to pay less & less attention to it. VERY IMPORTANT ~ DON'T turn it on yet!2. When they are used to seeing it sitting on the floor around the house & seem to be OK with it. (You'll know), they'll pay less & less attention to it. It's become a part of the 'scenery'. Now pick it up (STILL DON'T TURN IT ON!!) and rub it on their bodies. Just for a second or so & if they are calm about it (they can look at & sniff it, which is GOOD), praise them I give them a treat. Then work on lengthening the time you rub it on their bodies (with the side of the Dremel) & treat each time they are calm about it. If at ANY TIME they seem stressed or try to run away, back off & go back to shorter contact times. Make sure you stay calm yourself. Use a 'sing-song' or happy voice when talking to them & DON'T FORGET REALLY YUMMY TREATS!!Next turn it on in another room. Sit on the floor & hold it, LETTING THE DOG APPROACH YOU! NEVER go towards them with it, drag them to it, or hold it out towards them! When they start coming a little closer (remember, this is a new sound, so they will keep their distance, but if they don't run away, toss a nice yummy treat to them that they can get without coming closer the first time. WAIT & LET THEM APPROACH YOU! It's a good idea to have the best, smelliest treats that your dog loves with you (Make sure they know you have treats before you turn it on. Let them get a good whiff of the treat too. As you toss the treats to the dog, try to get the dog to take just one more step a little closer by tossing the treat so it lands a little closer to you each time.This takes patience, but BELIEVE me folks, the benefits outweigh the time this takes initially. But in the long run, you'll be SO GLAD you did it!When you can get the dog comfortable enough to come close, let the dog smell it. Maybe rub something nice & smelly on the outside casing, like a hot dog or some other food your dog LOVES!.(Keep the sanding band away from their body & don't let it get tangled in any long hair!The goal here is to get the dog to come close to you WHILE the Dremel is running, on his own & eventually, rub the Dremel housing on the dogs body while it's running.It's helpful to have someone to help you & feed GREAT treats while you are doing that. The dog will develop GREAT associations with the running Dremel, which is your goal! After a time & your dog will let you know when he/she is ready, to use it on toe nails. Quickly take just one \"swipe\" over the end of ONE NAIL & immediately let the foot go! Praise your dog like he/she just won you a million dollar lottery! Then feed some AWESOME treats & give MORE PRAISE!!Many dogs are too intimidated still to lay down & let you handle their feet with the dremel running at first. That's OK. Pick up a paw & just barely do the end of one nail at first. Work your way up to 2 nails, eventually doing a whole paw at one time. Make sure to reward LAVISHLY! You know your dog, so if you think that he/she is ready to try to do more nails at one time, go for it. Just don't push for too much too fast! I promise you, the patience will pay off!It WILL work if you invest the time to intitially introduce them correctly, WITH OUT FORCING THEM at any time. The years that will follow that you are able to get the nails filed down well in a very short amount of time, because you are not fighting with a dog pulling their feet away from you constantly, it's WELL WORTH HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES!!Believe me, I KNOW it works! My JRT was a very fearful puppy when I got her at 12 weeks old. I've NEVER had a dog, especially that young, that was so afraid of EVERYTHING! She's going to be 3 the beginning of November & I've very patiently gotten her over 99% of her phobias. She was afraid of EVERYTHING! Sheesh!!)If anyone needs any other advice or help, please feel free to leave a comment. I will be notified of any comments left on this post & I will respond. I'll GLADLY HELP IN ANY WAY I CAN!!This is a super over-simplified version, but I think you get the idea.Good Luck Everyone!!Since Amazon is currently out of this particular Dremel (with the bag) here is a link to the same Dremel, but this one is more expensive, because it has an end or adapter that you would never need if you are only buying this for doing your dogs nails.Dremel 7700-1/15 MultiPro 7.2-Volt Cordless Rotary Tool Kit", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2011", "summary": "BEST PET NAIL GROOMER AROUND!

It has been flawless as I put it through its paces with DIY audio projects, prototyping, PCB population, reworking, and fixing numerous electronics over the years.  Very comfortable, reliable, easily adjustable, serviceable, and works awesome!  If you are using a cheap-o iron with a ac plug hanging off the back you will really enjoy using this.  The quality of your work increases and you are less likely to burn or destroy the work you are doing.The temperature control is something that if you haven't experienced,  once you use it you will not want to be without.  If you are considering the (non-digital) WES51...spring the extra money for the digital temp control that the WESD51 has. You can fine tune the temperature to your liking and it will stay there!  Say you are working on really fine 28awg wires, you can dial it back some as to not melt insulation.  If you are doing a job that needs higher temp with larger components/ connectors, just crank it up.  It remembers what the temp was when you last shut it off as well.  When you fire it up, it says the temp it was last at, then tells you exactly what the temp is as it heats up.  As you are soldering, the temperature fluctuates on the screen a few degrees or so but its very stable once you dial in your preferred temp.It also has an auto-shut off feature to help you not burn your house down if you accidentally leave it on...happens to the best of us and on more than one occasion I have found the iron saved my posterior.  Weller has a huge assortment of different tips (sold separately) which are cheap and easy/fast to replace and its a great idea to have several on hand for different applications.  I prefer the really narrow and long screwdriver tip (Weller model: ETS)Long Conical Tip, 1/64\"which helps get into small places on PCBs (which is mainly what I work with).The only issue I have had with the iron is actually my fault...I bought one of those combination soldering iron stands that has the spool holder for your solder.  It looked great, had the solder right there, and I thought I had it made.  Unknown to me that it would be a problem, the design of the aftermarket stand let the tip of the iron come in contact with the spiral metal holder.  After the iron sat on and touched the stand (with the tip in contact) the stand acted as a heatsink and the soldering station kept trying to increase the temperature as it thought it was cold.  As you can guess what happened next, the actual iron (PESD51)Weller PES51 50-Watt Soldering Pencilburnt out.  Good thing that it is very easily replaced and actually not that expensive.  I simply bought a replacement and expect to get many more years out of the unit.A final fun tip:  Forget the sponge and water for cleaning the iron.  Take the sponge out and replace it with a soap-less copper scrubbing padChore Boy Copper Scrubbers: 2 Pack(similar to Chore Boy or copper/brass equivalent without soap).  I picked up a two pack at the dollar store for $1.00.  I attached the scouring pad to the base with a few alligator clips.  When you need to clean your iron, just dip the tip in the pad and it comes out clean and ready to use...no water and sponge required.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2013", "summary": "Great Soldering Iron - Just be cautious of non-OEM stands!"}

After replacing windows recently, I needed a saw to cut and complete the casing portion of the job. Rather than continue to beg and borrow from my neighbors, I opted to increase my tool collection. I pored over reviews here and elsewhere and finally decided to take the leap-- to a Bosch sliding compound saw here on Amazon. However, when I saw the hefty shipping/handling charges, and with a price increase moments before I clicked \"Buy,\" I rethought the purchase and opted for the Hitachi from another online vendor with a much more reasonable shipping charge.The saw came quickly and was in fine shape after travelling halfway across the country. I can see with less-than gentle handling the saw could punch a hole in the packaging, but mine survived the trip with no such effect. The saw is relatively compact, not too heavy, and the miters were right on right out of the box.  The slide is smooth and the cuts are good. While some have raved about the OEM blade that ships with the saw, I am not 100% thrilled- some cuts have been so-so, making small chips in the pine I was cutting. I also cut some oak base molding, and the cuts were again good, but not perfect. At this point, I want to attribute that to my own learning curve, rather than to the saw or the blade. I want to swap the original blade with a finishing blade I have, to see if there is improvement in the smoothness of the cuts.One gripe, and the reason for the 4 star rating, is with the safety button and handle. I do not have huge hands, and I find it somewhat awkward to depress the safety button and then grab the horizontal D-handle comfortably with the same hand to start the saw. Luckily for me, I am right-handed, as the handle controls are designed that way. Left handers had better be ambidextrous, or especially nimble with their pinky to be able to depress the safety button. Again, it could simply be getting accustomed to the saw. I did not experience this problem when using my friend's DeWalt sliding saw, however.I purchased a Stablemate Plus 100 saw stand (built like a truck) from Amazon, and because the mounting holes on the Hitachi are in a triangular pattern, I had to mount the saw on plywood first in order to then mount it on the saw stand.

I got the light accessory for it, and have found that to be a useful addition that allows me to easily see marks on the trim I'm cutting.

I gave a generous 3-star rating because this is still my preferred charger due to the amount of numeric data it gives you about your batteries and the charge cycle.Buyer beware however:  The computer controls the charge termination, under normal circumstances this is fine since it has triplicate protection from overcharging, namely -dv, a charge capacity limit, and temperature shut-down if all else fails.  HOWEVER, these three factors only feed as input to the computer.  If the computer crashes, which in my case may have been caused by a bad connection of the power adapter to the unit, the PWM charger can crash into \"full on\" charging, which basically completely melts down both the unit and your batteries, causes a lot of nasty smoke, and could easily cause a fire.  I documented this with photos et. al. for the company, and never even received a reply other than to reiterate that the molten remains of my charger was no longer under warranty.  I'm surprised the whole line didn't get recalled.  You can see more about this problem by googling it, or even pictures others have uploaded on Amazon, though there is a lot of mis-information and speculation of user error and bad batteries, which I assure you is not the issue.

If I didn't have some projects coming up that would have me working outside in the sun, I would've gone with the LED light instead, the DW7085, for less money and less hassle.Installation was easy as can be. It's two pieces, the power supply which mounts on the handle, and the laser assembly, which mounts above the blade. Six screws and five minutes, and a little wire-wrangling, and it's done.Then the work begins. Namely, the work of calibrating the laser so it points where it should, and you know where the blade's going to cut in relation to the light. A friendly tip here: just get a big framing square and do the advanced calibration setup. The instructions for that calibration are a lot easier to follow, weirdly enough, and are much more precise anyway. One of the big problems I had was how loose the adjustment screws are - it's far too easy to over-adjust, and worse still, running the saw seems able to knock the laser out of alignment ever so slightly. The beam itself is very narrow, which means it needs to be adjusted depending on which side of the material you're cutting off. It's almost more trouble than it's worth.The LED, by contrast, throws a shadow of the blade onto your material. It's always accurate without adjustments, the shadow is exactly the kerf of the blade, and it's ready to go as soon as you install it. On the other hand, it's not bright enough to be seen in sunlight, and I'm planning to build a deck with angled deckboards, so the laser was really my only option. I'll live with it because I have to, but I really wish DeWalt had done a better job with this laser. I'll likely wind up buying the LED whenever I get around to finishing the crown molding just so I don't have to fool with the laser any more than absolutely necessary.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 11, 2013", "summary": "It's just okay."}

I find it annoying to have to pull the chart out every time to find out how many clicks each setup needs.  Also the included wrench does not fit a Sawstop table saw.

I opened the package and right off the bat I saw problem #1. Rather than the three outlets described and pictured, there was one. Also, the outlet base is HUGE and a tremendous power strip space hog. I thought I'd try it anyway. Now, I have two of the Stanley remote light switches (HIGHLY recommended but Amazon was out of stock when I ordered this crazy thing). One runs three lamps in my livingroom and the other two lamps in the master bedroom. They've worked great for a long time. It was daytime so the lamps on the Stanleys were off.I plugged this new monster into an outlet in my office, plugged a lamp into it, popped the nine volt battery into the remote and pushed the on button. From six feet away without obstruction, nothing.I checked the remote outlet. Its lights were on and all looked well. Only when I stood directly in front of the outlet from about 18\" away would the lamp turn on and off occasionally. I decided the item was not only not as described but faulty too and that it would be the second thing of hundreds I've bought from amazon that had to be returned.I had some food shopping to do so I laid the outlet and the remote on my desk, left the house, walked to the my which was parked in the street 35 yards away from my office, hit the door unlock button on my key and NOTHING! It was stone dead. I tried a few times and finally gave up, opened the lock with the key itself and drove to the local service station to show this to a friend there. When I got there the remote lock/unlock on the key worked fine. I did my shopping, came back home, parked in my driveway this time, hit the lock button on my key and again, NOTHING! I thought \"Something, there is, in my neighborhood which is shutting down my car's remote switch!\" So, I walked into the house and because by this time it was getting late, I decided to put the house lamps on. I picked up the livingroom Stanley remote that controls three lamps and DEAD as a doornail. I walked into the master bedroom, grabbed the bedroom Stanley to turn the lights on in there and again, DEAD! Like pushing a stone with my thumb.Well, thank goodness I'm in Mensa! I had a little thinking session with myself. I thought \"What new things are in my home today that could be causing this? Can't be the new toilet seat, even though it's a fancy one. But HOW could it be the new remote? The outlet is unplugged and no one is pushing the button on the remote itself.\" On a whim I packed up the remote for return (I SHOULD have removed the battery first!) and carried the package out to my car. I unlocked the door with my key, drove up the block a way, locked the door again, walked back to my house and tried the Stanley remotes. They worked PERFECTLY, as they always had! When my wife got home later on the first thing she said when she walked through the door was \"Guess what. My remote door lock is stone dead!\" I told her.A friend feels this thing might be worth keeping just in case I feel like screwing up the neighbors for fun but I want it OUT of here and tomorrow, being Monday, I'm giving the package to my mailman to carry far away. Bottom line? If this thing didn't work at all it would be a vast improvement. DO NOT buy it! Really. DON'T BUY THIS!Anyway, gotta go now. I'm driving the return package over to the local Costco parking lot to watch shoppers as they try to get into their cars and realize their remote door unlocker doesn't work :-)", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "11 13, 2011", "summary": "Wow!

This was unacceptable to me since California's municipal water sources are heavily chlorinated.  It's so nasty, you can smell the chlorine coming out of the taps.  I can't stand the taste or smell of it.  I decided against reverse osmosis because of its costs and the amount of waste water it produces.  After much research, I settled on a gravity based microfilter, and Big Berkey came with lots of recommendations.So far, after nearly filtering 200 gallons, the Big Berkey is pulling all free chlorine out of the water.  Here is a pic that demonstrates:[...]The water on the right is tap water mixed with a chlorine/bromine indicator solution.

All I can say is \"wow!\" The keyless chuck clicks onto even the smallest bits with minimal effort. The 18 volt battery and the gearing give you plenty of power to drill through hardwood, concrete, metal - whatever. The instant rotation brake gives you great control. And the worklight/belt hanger arm is amazingly effective at both uses.  A great feature is the included 2nd battery. The ONLY problem I've had with this unit is the worklight arm: the screw holding the battery cover in place is of such soft metal the slots grooved out before the screw broke loose.

My mirror had always hung on the sink side, while a big blank wall occupied the space over the stretch of vanity between the mirror edge and the shower door. Once mounted atop that flat, blank wall, the Eva towel rack immediately added significant visual warmth within the room. The curves of this beautiful rack add an ambiance of depth when viewing the reverse through the mirror next to it, while the medicine cabinet's mirror on a perpendicular wall showcase its beauty even further.Installation was simple; though I called Moen to make sure that it was only supposed to have the four included screws with anchors, since each of the two mounts has four holes. I used the 3/16\" holes drilled into the wall as guides for the further gentle carving necessary to get the anchors through the wall without brute force. Then once I had the mounts gently holding against the wall, I referenced my level one more time for some fine-tuning before finally tightening the anchors in place.I think that of all the optional fixtures that have gone into the bathroom, this towel rack is the most influential.

We have them in our bathrooms. They come in handy to put extra towels on for guests, if they need them, or to put clean clothes on and keep them dry, that you wish to change into after your bath.I originally wanted this to add to our half bath on our main floor, thinking it would be good for extra guest towels or even as a place to put wet hats or gloves to dry out. When we received this I was very pleased at the nickel finish. It looks very rich and goes with almost any d&eacute;cor and does not have the overly shiny appearance of chrome. The problem occurred when we tried to put it up and discovered that we did not have enough wall space where I wanted it and still allow the bathroom door to open. When I went up and measured our other 2 towel racks they were several inches shorter. So we had to take down one of those, patch holes for the molly bolts it used and put this in the larger bathroom.So with that, the dimensions should be given. This is almost 25 inches wide and 7 inches tall. It also sticks out from the wall about 10 inches. It is large. The installation was relatively easy, after we figured out that an Allen wrench (provided) was what would open the back to allow it to be hung. The directions are really not complete. However, I have used Moen before and their customer service is very responsive in helping if you do have a problem in installing one of their products.This is a lovely accessory for bathrooms or even mudrooms; but the dimensional size should be stated, especially for online purchasing.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2013", "summary": "Train Rack"}

I feel qualified to comment on the Weller PC2 soldering iron:THE GOOD:+ Piezo electric ignition is easy, reliable and more convenient that traditional \"flint\" type ignitors which usually take multiple tries to start and worsen as the tip/flint ages. You simply press down on the ignition button to light it. So far this iron is a dream to start compared to my previous Radio Shack butane soldering iron.+ Exhaust vent on tip is located on one side of tip. This is important as it can help prevent burning your fingers and objects close by (wire, plastic surfaces etc) during operation (from the hot exhaust gas). My Radio Shack butane iron has vents around the tip and sometimes it`s easy to inadvertently damage things or burn your fingers if you are not careful.+ The tip that ships with this iron is a flat tip (two flat sides) which is better for soldering wires etc than the typical round tips. (I don`t think anyone is going to solder fine pitch SMD parts with any cordless soldering iron).THE BAD:- The biggest drawback in my opinion is the lack of an integrated fold-out stand as in the Radio Shack butane iron. With the RS iron you can unfold the stand with your thumb finger on the same hand you use to hold it (i.e. it`s a one-hand operation), which is extremely convenient and can prevent accidentally damaging something if you need to put down the iron & grab a part or more solder during use. The PC2 unfortunately has no fold-out stand and due to the round shape of the iron it WILL ROLL if you try to put it down. This is almost a deal-breaker for me for obvious safety reasons. If you are careful or use some sort of stand this will not be that big of a deal but considering that most likely you will be working in the field carrying around & using extra stuff is something I try to avoid.- The gas control is located at the bottom of the iron and requires two hands to adjust (one to hold the iron and one to twist the control). While this is good for safety it`s not great for convenience - you can adjust the gas control on the RS iron with the thumb on the hand that is holding the iron (again it`s a one hand operation on the RS iron).- The gas viewport at the bottom of the iron is pretty useless for establishing how much gas is left in the iron. For starters it`s white plastic which is not very transparent, so it`s hard to see how much gas is left. There are also no markings for reference. Finally the iron must be held horizontally to see any movement in the tank. On the RS iron the entire bottom of the iron is clear plastic so it`s very easy to see how much gas is left (especially if the iron is inverted).OVERALL, I am a little disappointed in this iron, despite the easy of ignition the BAD outweighs the GOOD. This iron could have been PERFECT if the above issues were resolved.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 18, 2012", "summary": "Good but could be improved"}

Amazon user Arc212 said that the flashlight does not have a momentary button on but mentions the momentary cycle.  This is something that should be expounded upon.  Once the flash light is on, the light can be disabled as long as you slightly depress the push-button but will reengage upon release; this action can also be used to rapidly cycle through the modes.

I picked one up for $1.50 at a local Army Surplus store.$10 awesome light, $1.50 for an awesome case.

My old tape was a Stanley. Not a bad tape but it had some annoying qualities and was getting pretty beat up.So I grabbed this one and took it to work. First thing I noticed was that it fits my hand nicely. I have big hands and this tape feels solid.Second was the stand off, I extended the tape over 6 feet before it got wobbly and bent. Nice.On top of that the numbers are nice and big, it's labelled on both sides and even the catch has an extra tab on the top for holding down with your foot or whatever else you may need to hook it on.It's a great tape and I'm really happy with everything about it with the exception of one thing.The main catch doesn't extend past the rubber bumpers on bottom of the box. What's interesting is that there is a circular groove that is clearly for pipes that the catch does extend into, so if you're measuring a pipe you can just set the tape down on one end and drag it out. No problem. I did use it a few times to measure out some PVC and it worked great.But on studs and other boards you can't just set it on the board and drag, I kept setting the tape on the end and dragging but the catch didn't extend past the box far enough to hook the board so I'd just drag the box along the board without the tape extending. When you work fast this gets annoying quick.After awhile I got in the habit of using my thumb to push the tape out a bit so I could hook it on a board but I miss the way my old tapes hooked by just placing them on the board and dragging.It could be my bad luck and I just got a bad egg. None of the other reviewers seem to have this problem. But if you have worked with wood for 15 years and have formed certain habits, changing them for new equipment is frustrating, especially with something as frequently used as a tape. I'd gotten to the point where I didn't even think about it anymore so the little change was pretty dramatic.When I get into the HVAC I imagine the magnet is gunna come in really handy.For general contracting I'd definitely recommend. If you're a long time woodworker you might be a bit disappointed in the catch, I guess it depends on how you work though.Overall the pro's outweigh the cons and I still really like this tape.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2011", "summary": "Great tape with one catch (or lack of)"}

We've never had a CFC last more than a year or two, but we had hopes for LEDs. We tried one of these. It worked rather nicely, but we installed it at the end of March and it died early in September. As we noted in the review title, that's just over five months. The incandescent bulbs we used to use in the same socket typically lasted 3 or 4 years. The CFCs we've been using for a while now last for 1 or 2 years. Apparently, LED bulbs can't even make it that long.We would have given this bulb more than one star, but the technology is really not here yet. Incandescent bulbs, while expensive to operate, are cheap to buy, and they last a long time. CFCs are cheaper to run, but need to be replaced more often. LEDs, we gather, are even cheaper to run, but the price is having to replace them quite frequently. We'll probably move back to CFCs, not to save money, but to help push the technology.

Once I finally pulled everything off and cleaned the toilet in all the places I couldn't get to before, installing this toilet seat was really easy to do. I didn't have the tools I needed&mdash;you're supposed to tighthen the nuts on it until the bottom extender pieces snap off&mdash;but because we may be moving and I'll probably want to take this seat with me, I just hand-tightened the nuts and will retighten if needed.

There is no danger of slamming down the toilet lid or \"donut\" seat with this product. We're in the habit of NOT closing the top lid itself because we tend to bang it, and I've stopped asking the man of the house to put the seat down for the same reason. I'll have to get him in the habit now, though, of getting it started closing when he's finished so it'll be down when I need to use it. My sitz bath won't fit, either, so that's a bummer, but it's not the end of the world.Because of the slowness of closing and the sitz bath not fitting, I would have given this three stars, but I've upped it a star because of the best thing about it: The whole seat lifts right off for easy cleaning! It has two stobs onto which the seat proper fits; a locking/unlocking mechanism on each stob allows you to unlock the seat and just lift the whole thing off. So you can really get in there to wipe up pee when nobody knows how it got there.Now, if I can just train the man to clean the toilet, or at least the outer parts of it, I'll be very happy.

I just don't think plastic female works well with metal male connectors. The overall build quality feels cheap as well. Like I said the whole thing is plastic or coated plastic and even the hose is plastic as well. The hose is fairly stiff and is not nearly as nice as Niagara hand-held shower head we purchased recently. Also the way the hand-held part sits in the main housing is not good.

I don't even want to think about his fingers under the seat!Installation was simple for Hubby :).  The seat is a round molded wood composite with an anti-microbial finish.  It is pleasant to sit on and has a nice feel.  I loathe plastic seats and hate having to sit on them at other's homes.  Our previous seats have been acrylic decorative seats that are very heavy.  After watching my son wrangle with the toilet seat in the middle of the night while half dead, I decided it was time to chuck them.  The tightness is amazing to the point of being rather overwhelming at times.  I am not sure if they have been over-tightened, but this lid takes a very long time to actually close.  Personally, that is not an issue in our home.  We don't care as long as the seat ends up closed eventually!  So it has been said countless times before... it is S L OOOOO WWW.  I love the fact that the top can be easily removed because of the lift-off hinges.  After a recent bout of stomach flu that crippled our family of five - it was nice to be able to just lift off and bleach properly.Highly recommend if you do not like having your toilet seat slamming and if you do not appreciate the feel of cold plastic on your rear-end.  Better priced than big box stores and quick shipping.

So I decided to try these \"no-flame\"  battery-operated candle substitutes.Obviously I was looking for something that was close to a real candle in appearance.I was pleasantly surprised, subject to a few caveats which follow.The \"flame\" on the candles is actually a small light bulb sunken a bit down into the \"wax\" (actually a hard plastic substance).  So its very obviously a light bulb if you put it on a low table where you can look down on it. On the other hand, if you put it higher up, say on a mantle as I did, it gives a pretty good representation of a real candle.

These are probably the best test leads I've used and they feel even more durable/comfortable than my Klein MM200 test leads that came with the meter.  What really got me excited about these test leads is the fact these test leads are also made in USA, similar to the alligator clips.However, although I really like fact these are made in USA, the fact that these tests leads have CAT IV protection and conform to safety standards IEC 61010-2-031:2002 but also comply to EN standards EN A1:2008.  I am a big advocate in safety and even though these Fluke leads have dual rated CAT IV protection and CAT III protection, strict compliance to IEC/EN standards is a must.However, besides being able to use Fluke's alligator clips (AC285) these leads are also entirely compatible with Fluke's TP220 industrial test probes.  This is a giant plus and those probes are most certainly a nice addition to any Fluke test lead.I also like the that the wire is flexible and also simonized-insulated.  Because of that, these leads have superb resistance to both cold and heat.  These leads can withstand -20 to 55 degrees in Celsius, can withstand a humidity percentage between 0 and 95%, which is 0 to 35 degrees in Celsius, and last, but certainly not least, can endure an Altitude of 2000 m.In addition, the test leads are also reinforced to provide maximum strain relief.  This is exceptionally helpful if your in a extremely tight situation or where that even level of comfort would certainly provide a cushion for when your hands might become tired.I had forgotten to mention this earlier but this entire product is CE, SA and UL listed.  Knowing this information is giant relief to me, as some test leads only have Intertek protection, if even that sometimes.  More protection is always a plus and is worth having, especially UL listed.Now another plus to these leads, they are fused.  So even if your meter isn't fused, these leads will provide that level of protection, so your not only protecting yourself, but also your multimeter as well.  However, it's crucial to remember these test leads have a maximum current of 10 Amps and at no time, should that ever be exceeded.It's hard to tell in the picture but the length of this product is 1.5 meters and these do fit standard 4mm banana connectors.  In addition, these also have pollution degree of 2 as well.  Plus they are double insulated as well.Overall, these are exceptional test leads.  They may be simple, but they truly are well built and designed and will likely last a very long time.  If your looking for a test lead that will provide not only CAT IV protection, but will provide great service, these are the one's to buy.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2011", "summary": "Exceptional set of Fluke Test leads."}

It looks like a regular, wicked candle, but I don't have to worry about going off to bed and leaving it burning.  The vanilla smell is nice but not too strong.  When on, it looks like it has been burned down about 1/3 of the way, and the top is wavy, as regular candles look after burning and softening.  The light is a nice, warm, yellowish light, as a flame would be.When you look straight down into it, you see the tiny bulb, but that isn't an issue for me.As much as I like it, there are reasons for not giving it 5 stars.  There is an on/off/auto switch on the bottom, and one that controls how many hours the candle is on when switched to automatic.  I really like that auto feature.  But the switches are tiny and the two look just alike.  It would be nice if there was contrasting labeling or if the switches were different shapes so it's easy to tell which switch is which.The candle doesn't come with batteries, and it takes 4 AA batteries.  It would be very nice if it came with them, but many products do not.  What would make that more acceptable is if the packaging more obviously stated the battery requirements.  It's there, but in tiny print on the side of the package.  If someone were buying this for a gift or to use immediately, it's would be easy to overlook the battery requirement and be disappointed.The packaging needs to be improved.  The candle comes in a clear plastic sleeve, but it is larger than the candle and the candle gets banged around a bit in shipping.  In my case, there were some minor scratches and marks on the wax.

To the limited extent an emotionally healthy adult can get excited about a Cat 5e ethernet patch cable, this cable does it.I'd also like to digress by sharing with you the fact that thanks to my fortuitous ordering of this wonderful cable, I just discovered I'm a veritable giant among men. Measuring myself with this cord, I am 2.8 cord lengths tall. It turns out that I was grossly mismeasured by the nurse at my last physical, and I am not 6'3\", but in fact around 11'2\". I am not joking. This is awesome. Other parts of my anatomy are also, it turns out, quite a bit larger than I, or my wife, have properly given me credit for. So, in addition to a reliable conduit for ethernet frames at an aggregate rate of 1 Gb/s, this cable has been a boon to my self worth and esteem among coworkers and friends' spouses. Really, an unbelievable bargain, even at full retail.UPDATE: It turns out I'm not actually a freakishly large engineer, but just a normal-sized engineer who was sent a cable significantly shorter than the advertised four feet of length. While my comments about the cable's quality stand, and this may just be an innocent packaging error, I feel it nevertheless appropriate to dock this product one star for causing me significant embarrassment during an Celtics open try-out day, as well as the expense of having to have yet another driver's license made.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2011", "summary": "Very nice cord, but either I'm a giant or this isn't 4 feet long"}

It's a great deal for $35.The light itself detaches from the mount; it simply snaps on and off. I thought this would adversely affect the pivoting system, which is a series of notches in the plastic housing, but it doesn't. The headlight stays where you put it, unless you bang it on something. A few reviews cited the plastic C-shaped arms breaking, but mine has held up nicely. The entire headlight is made of plastic, except the battery contacts. The light runs on one AA battery, although it doesn't include one. Alkalines, NiMH, and lithium primaries are all okay, but no 14500 or 14550. The screw-on battery door is located on the left (if you're wearing the headlight) side of the unit. Loosening it 1/4 of a turn prevents the light from coming on while in a pack.The switch is on the right side of the light. Press it once to turn the light on in high mode (90 lumens). Hold and the light quickly dims to low mode (3 lumens). From low, hold the switch to turn on medium mode (43 lumens). From medium, hold the switch to go to high mode. In any mode, double-click the switch to turn on the SOS mode. The SOS mode signals \"SOS\" in Morse Code in the medium mode. A single click in any mode turns the light off. The light will come back on in the last mode you used.The headband is wide and fully adjustable. It's comfortable to use.One of the key features listed is: \"Aluminum alloy features a Type III hard-anodized anti-abrasive finish.\" There is no aluminumm alloy, nor Type III finish. The entire light is plastic. That's not a problem for me, but it should be clearer in the description. The lens is glass, which I prefer. The LED is an XP-E R2, and it's behind a smooth reflector. This gives the light a lot fo throw for such a small unit. If you prefer a floodier light, this comes with a snap-on diffuser. The diffuser flips up when attached so you can still use the spotty beam. A spare O-ring is included. The description says a lanyard is included; there's no lanyard.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this light. The light itself detaches from the head mount so you can stash it in a jacket pocket and use it as a flashlight, which I really like. It takes just one commonly-available AA battery, which makes it cheap to feed. The output levels are bright enough and spaced apart for most uses.

It is the one thing I am always reluctant to try to deal with myself in the house. After a couple of email exchanges with Jeff and with his encouragement, I decided to give in and give this device a try. Like some others, when I first opened the box and saw all the pieces, I was frightened and thought I had made a mistake by agreeing to try this out. A cup of coffee and a half-hour of relaxing guitar playing later, I gathered myself together and went at it.Most of the parts in the box were not needed in my situation which turned out to be a basic install.  Straight-forward and just as carefully (and visually) described in the enclosed directions.  It took this dedicated non-plumber about ten minutes to install and set up. From the first flush, he change was apparent.The control box, which sits atop the toilet tank, has two dial controls. One for short flushes and one for longer ones. You can figure out which is for what.The choice of the short flush is made by simply tapping/pushing lightly on the top of the control box. A green light activates and the short flush ensues. The long flush is the default if the short one is not selected. Each dial has settings from 1-to-10 and is set to manage the flow of water to the around necessary to do the job.  Mine work great set at 2 and 7.Having only installed it about a week ago, I cannot vouch for what the water savings might be, but it is quite obviously saving water. Without it, the toilet would be using the equivalent of a number 10 flush each and every time it was used.I imagine that the installation may be more complex with some toilets - But with my own basic type, it was no problem.  I am actually less afraid of plumbing than I was before! The experience reminded me of the first time I allowed myself to open a computer to add something to it myself.

I tried another slightly smaller unit that used 4 AA batteries but not only did the light only last 5 seconds after the last motion detected, I would estimate the light produced was only in the 10-20 lumen range (even with 8 LEDs).  So when I looked at the Mr Beams website I saw this unit which claimed 100 lumens.  I was actually surprised at how small it was when I received it since its only slightly larger than the one that used AA batteries, but this uses 4 C-cell batteries.  I was also wondering about the light produced claim as I only saw a single LED element in the center.  However it does produce more light which is not as focused as most LEDs.  I assume it uses some sort of diffuser which spreads the light over a wider area which results in a \"warm white\" rather than \"bright light\" that most LEDs produce.  In addition the 30 second light duration claim was accurate - there are other products of a similar nature that claim 30 seconds and only last from 5 to 10 seconds.For mounting, the unit comes with a plastic mounting base with two screws and plastic anchors.  The light unit itself attaches to the base with a simple twist.  My only criticism is that the battery compartment uses a screw rather than a pressure release, so that will require the use of a screwdriver when replacing the batteries.  Given that situation, I hope that is not a frequent occurrence.Having had this for about a year now, I have a couple of other comments.  The motion sensor actually has a relatively wide area as the light goes on even if you get near my Dad's bathroom, not just under it.  If you add that to the number of times my Dad uses the commode, that has limited the life of the batteries fairly significantly.  I have had to replace them an average of every two months, so I am now buying C batteries in bulk.  In the end, while helpful, it didn't solve the issue of my Dad \"spraying\" so I installed a motion sensor for the main bathroom light (and this has reduced the 7 year life span of the  40 watt FL tubes in the main bathroom light to 6 months) - which given that he is 90 and has dementia, hasn't really helped all that much either.  And the one time it would have come in handy - when the power went out - the batteries died.  Regardless, I still think this unit is superior over others I have tried (4 other manufacturers) and I like the Mr Beams products - I have installed the step lights that use 4 AA batteries to light the way from my Dad's room to his bathroom (these units batteries lasted 6 months).", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2013", "summary": "Exactly what I was looking for"}

With a tool like the Porter Cable 3.0 Amp Oscillating Multi- Tool, I have a weapon in my hands; a weapon that makes household handyman tasks even simpler than before and increasing the number of tasks I am willing to conquer.This tool is made for cutting, scraping, sanding, and grinding and it comes complete with several different blades that are easy to switch out with the accessory clamp. The tool is comfortable to handle and can be used for cutting wood or metal. The blades are not as large as some may need, but they are large enough to handle the tasks/projects that most of us will encounter in our homes.Included in the kit, along with the blades, are a sanding platen and twenty- five sanding sheets. I don't do much cutting, but I do have to occasionally sand surfaces to get them primed for finishing and this tool is very nice for that purpose. I like, too, that the manufacturer helps get you started with so many sandpaper sheets. Many manufacturers include no sanding sheets at all, requiring another trip to the store before you can start a project.This Porter Cable tool has a thick, heavy- duty cord and a decent, although not perfect, plastic storage case. It seems like a tool that was made to last and given my limited usage, it will likely last a very long time.All and all, this is a very good tool and one I highly recommend for small to medium size jobs. More experienced handymen and handywomen may find it inadequate, but it suits the needs of the average person quite well.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 2, 2013", "summary": "Good Tool for the Less Experienced Handyman"}

However, after using that version, I found out that it only offered 44 lbs of torque whereas this single speed version offers a whopping 177 lbs!  You would think that Makita would somehow incorporate the larger torque in the variable speed version and not the other way around.  Nevertheless, it is an extremely well made tool.  Comes with a nice tool bag and even a belt holster.  Before the days of Li-Ion, the Ni-Cds couldn't hold a charge for more than a day and when you needed it, you would have to set aside at least 3 hours to \"re-charge\" it.  Thank goodness those days are over.  You can now leave these babies unattended for weeks even months at a time and when you need to use the tools, they are ready at your fingertips.  Okay, back to the review.  I use this single speed version to drive screws into plywood, drywall, and any other things that need high torque, super fast speed.  I don't recommend using this driver on torque sensitive screws because it will strip it easily.  For more sensitive jobs like putting together kits for my R/C hobby, I use the DF010DSE variable speed version which I found to be perfect for the job.  Ironically, the single high torque version is half the price of the weaker variable speed version. Go figure.  All in all, this is a great addition to my line of Makita tools.

Keeping in mind that like any tool, it has a specific role.  It suites my purpose perfectly.  I will try to give you a good idea of why it appeals to me.  Weigh that against your own requirements.PRO's:  (in no particular order)It uses 2 x CR123A lithium cells.  This is my preferred power source today.  Lithium cells have a 10 YEAR shelf life.  The whole idea of an \"emergency\" light source is that it is ready when you need it.  If you are \"on the job\" with this light, on a daily basis, the 18650 rechargeable may be a better choice.  This light handles both.\"Medium-long Throw\"  Those are my words.  Your light can be designed with a shallow reflector with heavy \"orange-peel\" to give a wide bright beam for close-up work, or with a smooth and very deep dish for a more focused, long-range bright spot.  This light is in-between, though it is clearly more of a thrower, it has the \"orange peel\" type reflector and a clean, clear \"spill\" area surrounding the spot.  Nice.12-level bi-directional rotating barrel switch, AND momentary cap switch.  THIS is my favorite feature.  None of that nonsensical twist on / off multiple time to change modes, then clicky-clicky-clicky to find out where you want the light set, and on some lights, then you get to PICK between which modes to use, because you can only choose 2 out of eight, like the Quark tactical.  BAH!  I hate that with a passion.  (and I own one.)I want my lights on LOW by default, and I'll power them up to what level I need / want at the time.  For my use, that is the most logical.  With this light, it will fire-up in what ever mode you have it set to, and it will stay until you change it.  You change it by grasping the barrel switch, and give it a turn.  Also, it \"wraps around\" so that when you get through all 12 settings, you don't have to go back the other way, the switch just continues right around and starts at the beginning again.  Beautiful.  Logical.  Simple.  Intuitive.Light beam quality:  This is a CREE Q5-based light.  These technologies change FAST, ok.  This WAS \"THE\" illumination source to have, until just recently.  Up against my XG-R5 based lights, in real-world look-see use, you're not gonna know the dif.  Yes, the R5 is more efficient.  It's not really an issue.Size:  Smaller than it looks in the pictures.  If I wrap my paw around it from the middle, the nose and tail will both stick out about an inch.  However, it's too big for EDC unless you are on the job with it in some capacity.  Roughly 2x\"C\" battery sized Maglite.  More than that, the \"weaponized\" crown around the lens makes pocket carry unlikely.  (jacket pocket, ok).It has a heavy-duty pocket clip can be re-located and locked back in place.  You can loosen / tighten the extra thick beveled body ring (which serves to prevent the light from rolling if you lay it on a flat surface) which lets you freely rotate the thick pocket clip ring, without scratching up the barrel.CONS:As far as I know, no one has built the \"Perfect\" light, yet.  I am obligated to nit-pick.Price.  At this price point (especially for a Q5 led), you should expect a LOT, and I do.  I would expect a top-qauality sheath, a much better lanyard (the one included is a joke) and at least one set of CR123A cells to get you started.  None of this is included.  I anticipate price drops on this light pretty soon.  In the mean time, Amazon's price is the best I'm finding.I don't like to score an item based on price, but it's more on VALUE for the dollar, and the missing sheath, lanyard, and batteries are unfortunate.  I'm obligated to remove a full point, as I can not remove 1/2 point.  So be it.Balance.  The heavy nose over-balances the light.  Most people would never notice this.  Others (and you know who you are) it may really bother them.  I find it impossible to \"choke up\" by moving the hand closer to the lens, because of the way the diameter varies along the shaft.  To get a balance, under-hand carry just extend the index finger loosely toward the lens.  Doesn't take much.  About 1/4 inch does it for me.  Huge difference.  Over-hand, won't matter.  Nose-heavy is an advantage in that position.  (my opinion)THE BOTTOM LINE:  Why buy the TA21 over OTHER 2x 123A lights?1) The outstanding 12-postiion, logical, rotating barrel switch.  As far as I know, the only one.  This is a truly outstanding set-up for me, I just cant say enough about that.  Did I mention that on \"Low\" setting (4 Lumens) it will run for 170 hours continuous?  That's about a week, boys 'n girls.  4 lumens is brighter than you think.  You'll see what you give it a try.2) Excellent durability, quality, water-proofing, etc.3) When larger size and weight are desirable for tactical reasons.#3 up there is important.  If you are NOT specifically interested in a heavy \"weaponized\" light, most people will be better served with a leaner, lighter version of the same thing. You can easily come in at half the weight for the same light and power.  If you want satisfaction, look closely at what will work best for YOUR anticipated use.As for me, I'm giving this light two very solid thumbs up, and give a respectful nod to FENIX, as I am forced to admit that to date, this is indeed the best light I've ever had my hands on.If this is the kind of light you are looking for, there is no way you'll regret this purchase.-Berk", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2010", "summary": "Best-in-class switch.

One of the big heavy old switches in a ceramic housing, back when they used BX wiring and small metal workboxes. However, there was not even close to enough room to fit this behind the switch. It's not Aeon Labs' fault, it's just that there is no way they could possibly make something small enough to squeeze in the tight spacings that were the norm in old electrical boxes, given how fat the old switches were and how small the workboxes were. So, please be aware that if you're looking to use this to retrofit existing switches, they really have to be relatively modern switches installed in modern, large workboxes. That's absolutely the only way you're going to have a chance of sneaking this in behind. Fortunately, one of the switches in the five gang panel was not being used anymore, so I pulled that out and used the empty space for the Aeotec switch. Even then, it was a very tight fit!The way this works is that you hook up your existing switch to some low voltage terminals on the Aeotec device. These are low voltage and just used to sense when somebody toggles the existing switch, and so that's why the terminals are so small: you're supposed to use small gauge wires. The reviewers who complained about stripped terminals didn't read the darn instructions and used full 14/16 gauge high voltage wires. You have to use something more like thermostat wire. In fact, that's exactly what I used and it worked great. You then hook up the high voltage terminals of the Aetec switch to your house power and load. You can either turn the light on and off with the old switch or with a zwave command; it doesn't matter which position the old switch is in. Flipping it always flips the state of the light. Very clever.One more piece of advice: unless you are installing this in new construction, you may not have all the wires you need. This product requires access to a neutral wire, and a lot of old installations didn't bother to run neutral to switch boxes. If you're in this boat, you'll have to either give up on this or do something potentially unsafe: use ground as neutral. I don't advise doing this, however, because you're completely doing away with all the safety advantages of a separate ground path. So, open the box you're planning on installing this in and making sure you've got all three wires you'll need before buying this.In summary, this is an extremely clever device that allows any switch to be used as a Zwave device if you have the right wiring and enough room left over in your box.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2014", "summary": "Works well, but not possible to install in old work boxes behind old switches"}

When I drive in at night and decide to feed the animals before going in the house (where I could turn on the outside lights) I know my motion sensitive garage light won't stay on long enough to still be on when I start back to the house.  When I turn off the barn lights, it's black as pitch out there.  A few of these in strategic places gives me enough light to get back to the house.  I only got one pack which includes two lights to begin with and when I saw how helpful they were, I ordered another pack.The only down side I can see is that in the cold and with the dog setting them off regularly, the batteries may not last terribly long, but I'll see and update.  I worried a little about the elements and decided to make them little hats out of foil which I affixed with a little tube of backward folded duck tape to the top.  So far that is working fine and even seems to diffuse the light a bit more giving somewhat more lighted area.  Of course this is a rustic setting so the fact that it doesn't look quite so neat doesn't matter.  Generally I like that fact that with the dark matte finish they blend into the ground cover and I'm not even aware they are there (except for their new hats :).Oh, one more thing.  The directions in the pack I got said I could set the tiny timer inside to 20 seconds or 5 minutes before the light went off.  I chose the 5 minutes but it doesn't stay on that long, more like 3 minutes.  I'm good with that, but thought I should mention it.I've only been using them a week, so time will tell about long term effectiveness and I'll update one way or the other, but so far so good.Update 3/23/13:  Still doing great.

This provided the motivation for buying an AC powered rotary tool.  Both Black and Decker and Dremel were under consideration, but when the B&D; RTX-B dropped down to $23, I made my choice, as it was half the price of theDremel 200 kit.An AC powered motor can deliver more power and torque, which typically means, more dramatic results.  The RTX-B motor has three speeds, 12,000 RPM, 24,000 RPM, and 30,000 RPM.  I generally use the lowest speed for better control, but it&#8217;s great to have a lot more power available if it is needed.  The battery powered Dremel 7300 has a top speed of 13,000 RPM, and delivers much less torque.The RTX-B has an ergonomic design, with a rubberized area near the front, that provides a nice grip.  The tool incorporates a pretty well designed flip lock safety mechanism to lock the shaft.  Replacing fittings and accessories isn&#8217;t as easy as the Dremel, but at least the chuck accepts all my old Dremel accessories, and does a superior job with them.  This is fortunate, as when it comes to accessories, Dremel&#8217;s product line is far superior, leaving B&D; in the dust.Some may not think it necessary, but with a rotary tool capable of high speeds, wearing safety glasses is a must.  A carrying bag that isn&#8217;t well suited to the tool is included, along with some screwdriver bits.While Dremel accessories are the best, they don&#8217;t necessarily have to be attached to a Dremel brand rotary tool.  Although the price has risen to close to $30, the B&D;&#8217;s RTX-B is a solid performer, which still remains less expensive than the Dremel 200 kit, and I don&#8217;t have any second thoughts about buying one.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2014", "summary": "B&D delivers a very functional, powerful, and economical rotary tool&#8230;"}

Unless they company changed designs or suppliers.  The pictures do not do product justice, now I can say if you are seeing the same picture as I am with this feedback, these are more what they look like and they look pretty light, they just look that way.  excellent product, excellent price and free shipping on top.  Will be back for more.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2014", "summary": "Great product..."}

These look identical and are exactly the same dementions.  They are razor sharp and mount in there perfectly.  Have not had a chance to try them yet but I have Freud blades in my table saw and router and they hold up great so I would expect the same from these.  I have learned not to be too hard on jointer blades.  Don't cut deeper than you have to and check your blades often.  I didn't bother to check them till I was getting bad cuts and was amazed at how badly I had worn them down.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2009", "summary": "replaces ridgid blades"}
